<h1> Introduction </h1>

<p>
Applications often make use of state information to simplify what is going
on. For example
<UL>
<LI>
Keeping file pointers to current file location
<LI>
Keeping current mouse position
<LI>
Keeping current customer value.
</UL>
In a distributed system, such state information may be kept in the client,
in the server, or in both.
 
 <P>
The important point is to whether one process is keeping state information
about <I>itself</I> or about the <I>other</I> process. One process may keep
as much state information about itself as it wants, without causing any
problems. If it needs to keep information about the state of the other
process, then problems arise: the process' actual knowledge of the state
of the other may become incorrect. This can be caused by loss of messages
(in UDP), by failure to update, or by s/w errors.
</p>
 
 <P>
An example is reading a file. In single process applications the file
handling code runs as part of the application. It maintains a table of
open files and the location in each of them. Each time a read or write is done
this file location is updated. In the DCE file system, the file server
keeps track of a client's open files, and where the client's file pointer
is. If a message could get lost (but DCE uses TCP) these could get
out of synch. If the client crashes, the server must eventually timeout
on the client's file tables and remove them.

In NFS, the server does
not maintain this state. The client does.
Each file access from the client that reaches the server must open the
file at the appropriate point, as given by the client, to perform the
action.

<P>
If the server maintains information about the client, then it must be
able to recover if the client crashes. If information is not saved,
then on each transaction the client must transfer sufficient information
for the server to function.
 
 <P>
If the connection is unreliable, then additional handling must be in
place to ensure that the two do not get out of synch. The classic example
is of bank account transactions where the messages get lost.
A transaction server may need to be part of the client-server system.

<h1> Application State Transition Diagram </h1>

<p>
A state transition diagram keeps track of the current state of an
application and the changes that move it to new states.
</p>

<p>
Example: file transfer with login:
<center>
<img src="app.png">
</center>
</p>

<p>
This can also be expressed as a table
<center>
<table border="1">
  <tr> <th> Current state <th> Transition <th> Next state
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="2"> login         <td> login failed <td> login
  <tr>                                <td> login succeeded <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="3"> file transfer <td> dir             <td> file transfer
  <tr>                                <td> get             <td> file transfer
  <tr>	                	      <td> quit            <td> quit
  <tr>	                	      <td> logout            <td> login
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<h2> Client state transition diagrams </h2>

<p>
The client state diagram must follow the application diagram.
It has more detail though: it <em>writes</em> and then <em>reads</em>
</p>

<p>

<center>
<table border="1">
  <tr> <th> Current state <th> Write <th> Read <th> Next state
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="2"> login
       <td rowspan="2"> LOGIN name password
                        <td> FAILED    <td> login
  <tr>                  <td> SUCCEEDED <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="7"> file transfer
              <td rowspan="2"> CD dir
                        <td> SUCCEEDED       <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> FAILED          <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>        <td rowspan="2"> GET filename
                        <td> #lines + contents   <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> ERROR              <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>        <td rowspan="2"> DIR
                        <td> #files + filenames <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> ERROR              <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>	      <td>             quit
                        <td> none <td> quit
  </tr>
    <tr>	      <td>             logout
                        <td> none <td> login
  </tr>

</table>
</center>
</p>


<h2> Server state transition diagrams </h2>

<p>
The server state diagram must also follow the application diagram.
It also has more detail: it <em>reads</em> and then <em>writes</em>
</p>

<p>
<center>
<table border="1">
  <tr> <th> Current state <th> Read <th> Write <th> Next state
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="2"> login
       <td rowspan="2"> LOGIN name password
                        <td> FAILED    <td> login
  <tr>                  <td> SUCCEEDED <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr> <td rowspan="7"> file transfer
              <td rowspan="2"> CD dir
                        <td> SUCCEEDED       <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> FAILED          <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>        <td rowspan="2"> GET filename
                        <td> #lines + contents   <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> ERROR              <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>        <td rowspan="2"> DIR
                        <td> #files + filenames <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>			<td> ERROR              <td> file transfer
  </tr>
  <tr>	      <td>             quit
                        <td> none <td> quit
  </tr>
  <tr>	      <td>             logout
                        <td> none <td> login
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
</p>

<h2> Server pseudocode </h2>

<p>
<code><pre>
state = login
while true
    read line
    switch (state)
        case login:
            get NAME from line
            get PASSWORD from line
            if NAME and PASSWORD verified
                write SUCCEEDED
                state = file_transfer
            else
                write FAILED
                state = login
        case file_transfer:
            if line.startsWith CD
                get DIR from line
                if chdir DIR okay
                    write SUCCEEDED
                    state = file_transfer
                else
                    write FAILED
                    state = file_transfer
            ...
</pre></code>
