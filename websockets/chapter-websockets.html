<h1> Web sockets </h1>
</div>

<div class="preface">
<p>
  Web sockets are designed to answer a common problem with web systems:
  the server is unable to initiate or push content to a user agent such
  as a browser. Web sockets allow a full duplex connection to be
  established to allow this. Go has nearly complete support for them.
</p>

  <h2> Warning </h2>
<p>
  The Web Sockets package is not currently in the main Go 1 tree
  and is not included in the current distributions.
  To use it, you need to install it by
  <pre>
    <code>
go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket 
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>
</div>
  

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The websockets model will change for release r61. This describes the
new package, not the package in r60 and earlier. If you do not have r61,
at the time of writing, use <code>hg pull; hg update weekly</code> to download it.
</p>

<p>
  The standard model of interaction between a web user agent such as a
  browser and a web server such as Apache is that the user agent makes
  HTTP requests and the server makes a single reply to each one.
  In the case of a browser, the request is made by clicking on a link,
  entering a URL into the address bar, clicking on the forward or
  back buttons, etc. The response is treated as a new page and is
  loaded into a browser window.
</p>

<p>
  This traditional model has many drawbacks. The first is that each
  request opens and closes a new TCP connection. HTTP 1.1 solved
  this by allowing persistent connections, so that a connection
  could be held open for a short period to allow for multiple
  requests (e.g. for images) to be made on the same server.
</p>

<p>
  While HTTP 1.1 persistent connections alleviate the problem
  of slow loading of a page with many graphics, it does not improve
  the interaction model. Even with forms, the model is still that
  of submitting the form and displaying the response as a new page.
  JavaScript helps in allowing error checking to be performed on
  form data before submission, but does not change the model.
</p>

<p>
  AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) made a significant advance
  to the user interaction model. This allows a browser to make a
  request and just use the response to update the display in place
  using the HTML Document Object Model (DOM). But again
  the interaction model is the same. AJAX just affects how the browser
  manages the returned pages.
  There is no explicit extra support in Go for AJAX, as none is needed:
  the HTTP server just sees an ordinary HTTP POST request with
  possibly some XML or JSON data, and this can be dealt with using
  techniques already discussed.
</p>

<p>
  All of these are still browser to server communication. What is missing
  is server initiated communications to the browser. This can be filled
  by Web sockets: the browser (or any user agent)
  keeps open a long-lived TCP connection to a
  Web sockets server. The TCP connection allows either side to
  send arbitrary packets, so any application protocol can be used
  on a web socket.
</p>

<p>
  How a websocket is started is by the user agent 
  sending a special HTTP request
  that says "switch to web sockets". The TCP connection underlying
  the HTTP request is kept open, but both user agent and server
  switch to using the web sockets protocol instead of getting
  an HTTP response and closing the socket.
</p>

<p>
  Note that it is still the browser or user agent that initiates the
  Web socket connection. The browser does not run a TCP server of its
  own. While the specification is 
  <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-17">
    complex</a>, the protocol is designed to be fairly easy to use.
  The client opens an HTTP connection and then replaces the HTTP
  protocol with its own WS protocol, re-using the same TCP
  connection.
</p>

<h2> Web socket server </h2>
<p>
  A web socket server starts off by being an HTTP server, accepting TCP
  conections and handling the HTTP requests on the TCP connection.
  When  a request comes in that switches that connection to a being a web
  socket connection, the protocol handler is changed from an HTTP handler to a
  WebSocket handler. So it is only that TCP connection that gets
  its role changed: the server continues to be an HTTP server for other
  requests,
  while the TCP socket underlying that one connection is used as a web
  socket.
<p>

<p>
  One of the simple servers HHTP we discussed in <a hef="../http/chapter.html">
    Chapter 8: HTTP</a> registered varous handlers such as a file handler
  or a function handler. To handle web socket requests we simply
  register a different type of handler - a web socket handler.
  Which handler the  server  uses is based on the URL pattern.
  For example, a file handler might be registered for "/",
  a function handler for "/cgi-bin/..." and a web sockets handler
  for "/ws".
</p>

<p>
  An HTTP server that is only expecting to be used for web sockets
  might run by
<pre>
<code>
func main() {
        http.Handle("/", websocket.Handler(WSHandler))
        err := http.ListenAndServe(":12345", nil)
        checkError(err)
}
</code>
</pre>
A more complex server might handle both HTTP and web socket requests
simply by adding in more handlers.
</p>

<h2> The Message object </h2>
<p>
  HTTP is a stream protocol. Web sockets are frame-based.
  You prepare a block of data (of any size) and send it as a
  set of frames. Frames can contain either strings in UTF-8
  encoding or a sequence of bytes.
</p>

<p>
  The simplest way of using web sockets is just to prepare a block
  of data and ask the Go websocket library to package it as a set of frame
  data, send them across the wire and receive it as the same block.
  The <code>websocket</code> package contains a convenience object
  <code>Message</code> to do just that. The <code>Message</code> object
  has two methods, <code>Send</code> and <code>Receive</code>
  which take a websocket as first parameter. The second parameter
  is either the address of a variable to store data in, or the
  data to be sent. Code to send string data would look like
<pre>
<code>
 msgToSend := "Hello"
 err := websocket.Message.Send(ws, msgToSend)

 var msgToReceive string
 err := websocket.Message.Receive(conn, &amp;msgToReceive)
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  Code to send byte data would look like
<pre>
<code>
 dataToSend := []byte{0, 1, 2}
 err := websocket.Message.Send(ws, dataToSend)

 var dataToReceive []byte
 err := websocket.Message.Receive(conn, &amp;dataToReceive)
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  An echo server to send and receive string data is given below. 
  Note that in web sockets
  either side can initiate sending of messages, and in this server
  we send messages from the server to a client when it 
  connects (send/receive) instead of the
  more normal receive/send server.
  The server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoServer.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  A client that talks to this server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoClient.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  The url for the client running on the same machine as the server
  should be <code>ws://localhost:12345/</code>
</p>

<h2>The JSON object</h2>
<p>
  It is expected that many websocket clients and servers will exchange
  data in JSON format. For Go programs this means that a Go object
  will be marshalled into JSON format as described in
  <a href="../serialisation/chapter.html">Chapter 4: Serialisation</a> 
  and then sent
  as a UTF-8 string, while the receiver will read this string and
  unmarshal it back into a Go object.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>websocket</code> convenience object <code>JSON</code>
  will do this for you. It has methods <code>Send</code> and
  <code>Receive</code> for sending and receiving data, just like the
  <code>Message</code> object.
</p>

<p>
  A client that sends a <code>Person</code> object in JSON format is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersonClientJSON.go" -->
  and a server that reads it is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersonServerJSON.go" -->
</p>

<h2>The Codec type</h2>
<p>
  The <code>Message</code> and <code>JSON</code> objects are both
  instances of the type <code>Codec</code>. This type is defined by
<pre>
<code>
type Codec struct {
    Marshal   func(v interface{}) (data []byte, payloadType byte, err error)
    Unmarshal func(data []byte, payloadType byte, v interface{}) (err error)
}
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
  The type <code>Codec</code> implements the <code>Send</code> and
  <code>Receive</code> methods used earlier.
</p>

<p>
  It is likely that websockets will also be used to exchange XML data.
  We can build an XML <code>Codec</code> object by wrapping the
  XML marshal and unmarshal methods discussed in 
  <a href="../xml/chapter-xml.html">Chapter 12: XML</a>
  to give a suitable <code>Codec</code> object.
</p>


<p>
  We can create a <code>XMLCodec</code>  package
  in this  way:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . src/xmlcodec/XMLCodec.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  We can then serialise Go objects such as a <code>Person</code>
  into an XML document and send it
  from a client to a server by 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersonClientXML.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  A server which receives this and just prints information to the console is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersonServerXML.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Web sockets over TLS </h2>
<p>
  A web socket can be built above a secure TLS socket.
  We discussed in 
  <a href="../http/chapter.html"> Chapter 8: HTTP</a>
  how to use a TLS socket using the certificates from 
  <a href="../security"> Chapter 7: Security</a>.
  That is used unchanged for web sockets. that is, we use
  <code>http.ListenAndServeTLS</code> instead of
   <code>http.ListenAndServe</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the echo server using TLS
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoServerTLS.go" -->
  The client is the same echo client as before. All that changes is the
  url, which uses the "wss" scheme instead of the "ws" scheme:
<pre>
<code>
  EchoClient wss://localhost:12345/
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<!--
<h2> Sub-protocol </h2>
<p>
  Web sockets use a particular protocol above TCP.
  This is specified by the IETF.
  But it is a means for carrying messages, and the
  messages sent on
  web sockets must be comprehensible to both the client and server.
  This is the issue with application layer protocols that this book
  covered in 
  <a href="../protocol/chapter.html"> 
    Chapter 5: Application-Level Protocols</a>.
</p>

<p>
  So far in this chapter we have dealt 
  (in an informal manner) with the situation
  where both sides have  a shared, known protocol on top of the 
  web sockets layer: one side sends a particular JSON object, 
  the other receives it,
  etc. One thing that should be painfully obvious is that in the 
  networking world protocols do not stay static. Protocols change
  versions; new protocols get overlaid on top of old protocols;
  security and authentication mechanisms change.
</p>

<p>
  <em> As an aside, we see the disastrous decision by the HTML 5
    working groups to eliminate version information in the HTML
    header information. Justified by a "continuous improvement" model,
    neither client nor server will have the faintest idea of which
    micro-point version of HTML 5 they will be dealing with, and code
    will probably get horrendously complicated with queries as to which
    HTML 5 features are supported, and workarounds when they aren't.
    It's quite sad to see sound engineering principles just
    tossed aside with the phrase: 
    <a href="http://www.conceivablytech.com/5277/business/no-more-version-numbers-for-html">
      "A living standard".</a>
    Really, it's just saying that they've lost control over the process.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  In setting up a web socket, a <code>Config</code> can be specified.
  This can contain information about which version of the web sockets
  protocol which is used, but can also carry information about the 
  sub-protocols your application can use, in the string array
  <code>Protocol</code>. For example, this could
  state which versions of the application protocol are supported,
  whether a secure or insecure protocol can be used, etc.
</p>

<p>
  We note that while there is a parameter in <code>Dial()</code> called
  <code>protocol</code>, this parameter is ignored so there is no point
  in setting it.
</p>

<p>
  The negotiation about subprotocols takes place during the websocket
  handshake phase. This is not presently visible in any way through the
  websocket API, so there is no way that the server can add any
  negotiation code. The current code base examines the client's request
  and (incorrectly) rejects it if more than one subprotocol is
  specified.
</p>

<p>
  So right now, this part of websockets can be set for a client,
  but cannot be handled by a server. Here is an example client:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersonClientProtocol.go" -->

<!--
<p>
  The second field of a web socket client is for the same web socket
  to carry differing protocols. The (sub)-protocol is carried in the
  HTTP attribute of <code>Sec-WebSocket-Protocol</code>. The attribute
  <code>Protocol</code> of the <code>ws.Conn</code> can be
  used by the server to distinguish between protocols.
  <code>
    <pre>
println("Protocol is", conn.Protocol)
    </pre>
  </code>
  As a toy example, the protocols could be <code>echo</code>, 
  <code>echoToUpper</code> and <code>echoToLower</code>
</p>
-->

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
  The web sockets standard is nearing completion and no major changes
  are anticipated. This will allow HTTP user agents and servers to set
  up bi-directional socket connections and should make certain 
  interaction styles much easier. Go has nearly complete support
  for web sockets.
