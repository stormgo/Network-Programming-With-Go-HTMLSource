  <h1> Data serialisation </h1>
</div>

<div class="preface">
<p>
  Communication between a client and a service requires the
  exchange of data. This data may be highly structured, but
  has to be serialised for transport. This chapter looks at
  the basics of serialisation and then considers several
  techniques supported by Go APIs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="generated-toc" class="generate_from_h2"></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

A client and server need to exchange information via messages. 
TCP and UDP provide the transport mechanisms to do this.
The two processes also have to have a protocol in place so that
message exchange can take place meaningfully.
</p>

<p>
Messages are sent across the network as a sequence of bytes, which
has no structure except for a linear stream of bytes.
We shall address the various possibilities for messages and the 
protocols that define them in the next chapter. In this chapter
we concentrate on a component of messages - the data that is transferred.
</p>

<p>
  A program will typically build complex data structures to hold the
  current program state. In conversing with a remote client or service,
  the program will be attempting to transfer such data structures
  across the network - that is, outside of the application's own 
  address space.
</p>

<p>
Programming
languages use structured data such as
<ul>
  <li> records/structures
  </li>
  <li> variant records
  </li>
  <li> array - fixed size or varying
  </li>
  <li> string - fixed size or varying
  </li>
  <li> tables - e.g. arrays of records
  </li>
  <li> non-linear structures such as
      <ul>
	<li> circular linked list
	</li>
	<li> binary tree
	</li>
	<li> objects with references to other objects
	</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
None of IP, TCP or UDP packets know the meaning of any of these
data types. All that they can contain is a sequence of bytes.
Thus an application has to <em> serialise </em> any data into
a stream of bytes in order to write it, and <dem>deserialise</dem>
the stream of bytes back into suitable data structures on reading it.
These two operations are known as <em>marshalling</em> and
<em>unmarshalling</em> respectively.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider sending the following variable length table of
two columns of variable
length strings:
<center>
<code><table border="1">
<tr> <td> fred <td>    programmer
<tr> <td> liping <td>  analyst
<tr> <td> sureerat <td> manager
</table></code>
</center>

This could be done by in various ways. For example, suppose that it
is known that the data will be an unknown number of rows in a
two-column table. Then a marshalled form could be
<code><pre>
    3                // 3 rows, 2 columns assumed
    4 fred           // 4 char string,col 1
    10 programmer    // 10 char string,col 2
    6 liping         // 6 char string, col 1
    7 analyst        // 7 char string, col 2
    8 sureerat       // 8 char string, col 1
    7 manager        // 7 char string, col 2
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Variable length things can alternatively have their length indicated
by terminating them with an "illegal" value, such as '\0' for
strings:
<code><pre>
    3
    fred\0        
    programmer\0
    liping\0
    analyst\0
    sureerat\0
    manager\0
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, it may be known that the data is a 3-row fixed 
table of two columns of
strings of length 8 and 10 respectively.
Then a serialisation could be
<code><pre>
    fred\0\0\0\0
    programmer
    liping\0\0
    analyst\0\0\0
    sureerat
    manager\0\0\0
</pre></code>
</p>

<p>
<em> Any of these formats is okay - but the 
message exchange protocol must
specify which one is used, or allow it to be determined at runtime. </em>
</p>

<h2> Mutual agreement </h2>
<p>
  The previous section gave an overview of the issue of data
  serialisation. In practise, the details can be considerably more 
  complex. For example, consider the first possibility, marshalling
  a table into the stream
  <code>
    <pre>
    3
    4 fred
    10 programmer
    6 liping
    7 analyst
    8 sureerat
    7 manager
    </pre>
  </code>
  Many questions arise. For example, how many rows are possible for the
  table - that is, how big an integer do we need to describe the row size? 
  If it is 255 or less,
  then a single byte will do, but if it is more, then a short, integer
  or long may be needed. A similar problem occurs for the length of
  each string. With the characters themselves, to which character
  set do they belong? 7 bit ASCII? 16 bit Unicode? The question of
  character sets is discussed at length in a later chapter.
</p>

<p>
  The above serialisation is <em>opaque</em> or <em>implicit</em>.
  If data is marshalled using the above format, then there is nothing
  in the serialised data to say how it should be unmarshalled. The
  unmarshalling side has to know exactly how the data is serialised
  in order to unmarshal it correctly. For example, if the number
  of rows is marshalled as an eight-bit integer, but unmarshalled as
  a sixteen-bit integer, then an incorrect result will occur as the receiver
  tries to unmarshall 3 and 4 as a sixteen-bit integer, and 
  the receiving program will almost certainly fail later.
</p>

<p>
  An early well-known serialisation method is XDR (external data
  representation) used by Sun's RPC, later known as ONC
  (Open Network Computing).
  XDR is defined by RFC 1832 and it is instructive to see
  how precise this specification is. Even so, XDR is inherently
  type-unsafe as serialised data contains no type information.
  The correctness of its use in ONC is ensured primarily by 
  compilers generating code for both marshalling and unmarshalling.
</p>

<p>
  Go contains no explicit support for marshalling or
  unmarshalling opaque serialised data.
  The RPC package in Go does not use XDR, but instead uses
  "gob" serialisation, described later in this chapter.
</p>

<h2> Self-describing data </h2>
<p>
  Self-describing data carries type information along with the data.
  For example, the previous data might get encoded as
  <code>
    <pre>
table
   uint8 3
   uint 2
string
   uint8 4
   []byte fred
string
   uint8 10 
   []byte programmer
string
   uint8 6 
   []byte liping
string
   uint8 7 
   []byte analyst
string
   uint8 8 
   []byte sureerat
string
   uint8 7
   []byte manager
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Of course, a real encoding would not normally be as cumbersome and verbose
  as in the example: small integers would be used as type markers
  and the whole data would be packed in as small a byte array
  as possible. (XML provides a counter-example, though.).
  However, the principle is that the marshaller will generate such
  type information in the serialised data. The unmarshaller will
  know the type-generation rules and will be able to use this to
  reconstruct the correct data structure.
</p>

<h2> ASN.1 </h2>
<p>
  Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) was originally designed in 1984
  for the telecommunications industry. ASN.1 is a complex standard,
  and a subset of it is supported by Go in the package "asn1".
  It builds self-describing serialised data from complex data
  structures. Its primary use in current networking systems is
  as the encoding for X.509 certificates which are heavily used
  in authentication systems. The support in Go is based on what
  is needed to read and write X.509 certificates.
</p>
<p>
  Two functions allow us to marshal and unmarshal data
  <code>
    <pre>
func Marshal(val interface{}) ([]byte, os.Error)
func Unmarshal(val interface{}, b []byte) (rest []byte, err os.Error)
    </pre>
  </code>
  The first marshals a data value into a serialised byte array, and the second
  unmarshals it. However, the first argument of type
  <code>interface</code> deserves further examination.
  Given a variable of a type, we can marshal it by just passing its
  value.
  To unmarshal it, we need a variable of a named type that will
  match the serialised data. The precise details of this are discussed
  later. But we also need to make sure that the variable is allocated
  to memory for that type, so that there is actually existing
  memory for the unmarshalling to write values into.
</p>

<p>
  We illustrate with an almost trivial example, of marshalling and unmarshalling
  an integer. We can pass an integer value to <code>Marshal</code>
  to return a byte array, and unmarshal the array into an integer variable
  as in this program:

<!--
. We can find the time from the function
  <code>LocalTime</code> in package "time". We can marshal this
  value directly as type <code>net.Time</code>. To unmarshal,
  we need the address a variable also of that type. BUT: that
  variable must have allocated space, which we can ensure
  by using the operator <code>new</code>. 
-->

  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ASN1.go" -->
  The unmarshalled value, is of course, 13.
</p>

<p>
  Once we move beyond this, things get harder. In order
  to manage more complex data types, we have to look more closely
  at the data structures supported by ASN.1, and how ASN.1
  support is done in Go.
</p>


<p>
  Any serialisation method will be able to handle certain data types
  and not handle some others. So in order to determine the suitability
  of any serialisation such as ASN.1, you have to look at the possible 
  data types supported versus those you wish to use in your application. 
  The following ASN.1 types are taken from 
  http://www.obj-sys.com/asn1tutorial/node4.html
</p>

<p>
  The simple types are
  <ul>
    <li>
      BOOLEAN: two-state variable values
    </li>
    <li>
      INTEGER: 	 	Model integer variable values
    </li>
    <li>
      BIT STRING: 	 	Model binary data of arbitrary length
    </li>
    <li>
      OCTET STRING: 	 	Model binary data whose length is a multiple of eight
    </li>
    <li>
      NULL: 	 	Indicate effective absence of a sequence element
    </li>
    <li>
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER: 	 	Name information objects
    </li>
    <li>
      REAL: 	 	Model real variable values
    </li>
    <li>
      ENUMERATED: 	 	Model values of variables with at least three states
    </li>
    <li>
      CHARACTER STRING: 	 	Models values that are strings of characters fro    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Character strings can be from certain character sets
  <ul>
    <li>
      NumericString: 	0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and space
    </li>
    <li>
      PrintableString:  	Upper and lower case letters, digits, space, 
apostrophe, left/right parenthesis, plus sign, comma, hyphen, full stop, solidus, colon, equal sign, question mark
    </li>
    <li>
      TeletexString (T61String): The Teletex character set in CCITT's T61, space, and delete
    </li>
    <li>
      VideotexString: 	The Videotex character set in CCITT's T.100 and T.101, space, and delete
    </li>
    <li>
      VisibleString (ISO646String): 	Printing character sets of international ASCII, and space
    </li>
    <li>
      IA5String:  	International Alphabet 5 (International ASCII)
    </li>
    <li>
      GraphicString 	25 	All registered G sets, and space
GraphicString
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  And finally, there are the structured types:
  <ul>
    <li>
      SEQUENCE: 	Models an ordered collection of variables of different type
    </li>
    <li>
      SEQUENCE OF: 	Models an ordered collection of variables of the same type
    </li>
    <li>
      SET: 	Model an unordered collection of variables of different types
    </li>
    <li>
      SET OF: 	Model an unordered collection of variables of the same type
    </li>
    <li>
      CHOICE: 	Specify a collection of distinct types from which to choose one type
    </li>
    <li>
      SELECTION: 	Select a component type from a specified CHOICE type
    </li>
    <li>
      ANY:	Enable an application to specify the type
    Note: ANY is a deprecated ASN.1 Structured Type. It has been replaced with X.680 Open Type.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Not all of these are supported by Go. Not all possible values are
  supported by Go. The rules as given in the Go "asn1" package 
  documentation are
  <ul>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 INTEGER can be written to an int or int64. If the encoded value does not fit in the Go type, Unmarshal returns a parse error.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 BIT STRING can be written to a BitString.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 OCTET STRING can be written to a []byte.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER can be written to an ObjectIdentifier.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 ENUMERATED can be written to an Enumerated.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 UTCTIME or GENERALIZEDTIME can be written to a *time.Time.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 PrintableString or IA5String can be written to a string.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any of the above ASN.1 values can be written to an interface{}. The value stored in the interface has the corresponding Go type. For integers, that type is int64.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF x or SET OF x can be written to a slice if an x can be written to the slice's element type.
    </li>
    <li>
      An ASN.1 SEQUENCE or SET can be written to a struct if each of the elements in the sequence can be written to the corresponding element in the struct. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Go places real restrictions on ASN.1. For example, ASN.1 allows integers
  of any size, while the Go implementation will only allow upto
  signed 64-bit integers. On the other hand, Go distinguishes between
  signed and unsigned types, while ASN.1 doesn't. So for example,
  transmitting a value of <code>uint64</code> may fail if it is
  too large for <code>int64</code>,
</p>

<p>
  In a similar vein, ASN.1 allows several different character sets.
  Go only supports PrintableString and IA5String (ASCII).
  ASN.1 does not support Unicode characters (which require the 
  BMPString ASN.1 extension). The basic Unicode character set of Go
  is not supported, and if an application requires transport
  of Unicode characters, then an encoding such as UTF-7 will be
  needed. Such encodings are discussed in a later chapter on character sets.
</p>

<p>
  We have seen that a value such as an integer can be easily marshalled
  and unmarshalled. Other basic types such as booleans and reals can
  be similarly dealt with. Strings which are composed entirely of ASCII
  characters can be marshalled and unmarshalled. However, if the string
  is, for example, "hello \u00bc" which contains
  the non-ASCII character '&#188;' then an error will occur:
  "ASN.1 structure error: PrintableString contains invalid character".
  This code works, as long as the string is only composed of
  printable characters:
  <code>
    <pre>
	s := "hello"
	mdata, _ := asn1.Marshal(s)

	var newstr string
	asn1.Unmarshal(mdata, &newstr)
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  ASN.1 also includes some "useful types" not in the above list,
  such as UTC time.
  Go supports this UTC time type. This means that you can pass time
  values in a way that is not possible for other data values.
  ASN.1 does not support pointers, but Go has special code to
  manage pointers to time values. The function
  <code>GetLocalTime</code> returns <code>*time.Time</code>.
  The special code marshals this, and it can be unmarshalled into
  a pointer variable to a <code>time.Time</code> object. Thus this
  code works
  <code>
    <pre>
	t := time.LocalTime()
	mdata, err := asn1.Marshal(t)

	var newtime = new(time.Time)
	_, err1 := asn1.Unmarshal(&newtime, mdata)
    </pre>
  </code>
  Both <code>LocalTime</code> and <code>new</code> handle
  pointers to a <code>*time.Time</code>, and Go looks after
  this special case.
</p>

<p>
  In general, you will probably want to marshal and unmarshal structures.
  Apart from the special case of time, Go will happily deal with
  structures, but not with pointers to structures. Operations such
  as <code>new</code> create pointers, so you have to dereference them
  before marshalling/unmarshalling them.
  Go normally dereferences pointers for you when needed,
  but not in this case. These both work for a type
  <code>T</code>:
  <code>
    <pre>
// using variables
var t1 T
t1 = ...
mdata1, _ := asn1.Marshal(t)

var newT1 T
asn1.Unmarshal(&amp;newT1, mdata1)

/// using pointers
var t2 = new(T)
*t2 = ...
mdata2, _ := asn1.Marshal(*t2)

var newT2 = new(T)
asn1.Unmarshal(newT2, mdata2)
    </pre>
  </code>
  Any suitable mix of pointers and variables will work as well.
</p>

<p>
  The fields of a structure must all be exportable, that is, field names
  must begin with an uppercase letter. Go uses the <code>reflect</code>
  package to marshal/unmarshal structures, so it must be able to examine
  all fields. This type cannot be marshalled:
  <code>
    <pre>
      type T struct {
          Field1 int
          field2 int // not exportable
      }
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  ASN.1 only deals with the data types. It does not consider the names
  of structure fields. So the following type <code>T1</code>
  can be marshalled/unmarshalled into type <code>T2</code> as the
  corresponding fields are the same types:
  <code>
    <pre>
type T1 struct {
    F1 int
    F2 string
}

type T2 struct {
    FF1 int
    FF2 string
}
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Not only the types of each field must match, but the number must match
  as well. These two types don't work:
  <code>
    <pre>
type T1 struct {
    F1 int
}

type T2 struct {
    F1 int
    F2 string // too many fields
}
    </pre>
  </code>

  <h3> ASN.1 daytime client and server </h3>
<p>
  Now (finally) let us turn to using ASN.1 to transport data across
  the network.
</p>

<p>
  We can write a TCP server that delivers the current time as an
  ASN.1 Time type, using the techniques of the last chapter.
  A server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ASNDaytimeServer.go" -->
  which can be compiled to an executable such as 
  <code>ASN1DaytimeServer</code> and run with no arguments.
  It will wait for connections and then send the time as an
  ASN.1 string to the client.
</p>

<p>
  A client is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ASNDaytimeClient.go" -->
  This connects to the service given in a form such as
  <code>localhost:1200</code>, reads the TCP packet and decodes
  the ASN.1 content back into a string, which it prints.
</p>

<p>
  We should note that neither of these two - the client or the server -
  are compatable with the text-based clients and servers of the
  last chapter. This client and server are exchanging ASN.1
  encoded data values, not textual strings.
</p>

<h2> JSON </h2>
<p>
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It was designed to be a lighweight means of passing data between
JavaScript systems. It uses a text-based format and is sufficiently
general that it has become used as a general purpose serialisation
method for many programming languages.
</p>

<p>
JSON serialises objects, arrays and basic values. The basic values include
string, number, boolean values and the null value. Arrays are a comma-separated
list of values that can represent arrays, vectors, lists or sequences of
various programming languages. They are delimited by square brackets "[ ... ]".
Objects are represented by a list of "field: value" pairs enclosed in
curly braces "{ ... }".
</p>

<p>
For example, the table of employees given earlier could be written as an array of
employee objects:
<pre>
<code>
[
   {Name: fred, Occupation: programmer},
   {Name: liping, Occupation: analyst},
   {Name: sureerat, Occupation: manager}
]
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
There is no special support for complex data types such as dates,
no distinction between number types, no recursive types, etc.
JSON is a very simple language, but nevertheless can be quite
useful. Its text-based format makes it easy for people to use,
even though it has the overheads of string handling.
</p>

<p>
  From the Go JSON package specification, 
  marshalling uses the following type-dependent default encodings:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Boolean values encode as JSON booleans.
    </li>
    <li>
      Floating point and integer values encode as JSON numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
      String values encode as JSON strings, with each 
      invalid UTF-8 sequence replaced by the encoding of the 
      Unicode replacement character U+FFFD.
    </li>
    <li>
      Array and slice values encode as JSON arrays,
      except that []byte encodes as a base64-encoded string.
    </li>
    <li>
      Struct values encode as JSON objects. 
      Each struct field becomes a member of the object. 
      By default the object's key name is the struct field 
      name converted to lower case. If the struct field has a tag, 
      that tag will be used as the name instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Map values encode as JSON objects. 
      The map's key type must be string; 
      the object keys are used directly as map keys.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pointer values encode as the value pointed to. 
      (Note: this allows trees, but not graphs!).
      A nil pointer encodes as the null JSON object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Interface values encode as the value contained in the interface. 
      A nil interface value encodes as the null JSON object.
    </li>
    <li>
      Channel, complex, and function values cannot be encoded in JSON. 
      Attempting to encode such a value causes Marshal 
      to return an InvalidTypeError.
    </li>
    <li>
      JSON cannot represent cyclic data structures and Marshal 
      does not handle them. Passing cyclic structures to 
      Marshal will result in an infinite recursion. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  A program to store JSON serialised data into a file is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . SaveJSON.go" -->
  and to load it back into memory is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . LoadJSON.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  The serialised form is (formatted nicely)
  <code>
    <pre>
{"Name":{"Family":"Newmarch",
         "Personal":"Jan"},
 "Email":[{"Kind":"home","Address":"jan@newmarch.name"},
          {"Kind":"work","Address":"j.newmarch@boxhill.edu.au"}
         ]
}
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<h3> A client and server </h3>
<p>
  A client to send a person's data and read it back ten times is 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . JSONEchoClient.go" -->

  and the corrsponding server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . JSONEchoServer.go" -->
</p>


</p>

<h2> The gob package </h2>
<p>
  Gob is a serialisation technique specific to Go. It is designed to
  encode Go data types specifically and does not at present have support
  for or by any other languages. It supports all Go data types except
  for channels, functions and interfaces. It supports integers of all
  types and sizes, strings and booleans, structs, arrays and slices.
  At present it has some problems with circular structures such as
  rings, but that will improve over time.
</p>

<p>
  Gob encodes type information into its serialised forms. This is far
  more extensive than the type information in say an X.509 serialisation,
  but far more efficient than the type information contained in an
  XML document. Type information is only included once for each piece
  of data, but includes, for example, the names of struct fields.
</p>

<p>
  This inclusion of type information makes Gob marshalling and unmarshalling
  fairly robust to changes or differences between the marshaller and
  unmarshaller. For example, a struct
  <code>
    <pre>
 struct T {
     a int
     b int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
can be marshalled and then unmarshalled into a different struct
  <code>
    <pre>
 struct T {
     b int
     a int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
  where the order of fields has changed. It can also cope with missing
  fields (the values are ignored) or extra fields (the fields are left
  unchanged). It can cope with pointer types, so that the above struct
  could be unmarshalled into
  <code>
    <pre>
 struct T {
     *a int
     **b int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
  To some extent it can cope with type coercions so that an <code>int</code>
  field can be broadened into an <code>int64</code>, but not with 
  incompatable types such as <code>int</code> and <code>uint</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To use Gob to marshall a data value, you first need to create an
  <code>Encoder</code>. This takes a <code>Writer</code> as parameter
  and marshalling will be done to this write stream. The encoder
  has a method <code>Encode</code> which marshalls the value to
  the stream. This method can be called multiple times on multiple
  pieces of data. Type information for each data type
  is only written once, though.
</p>

<p>
  You use a <code>Decoder</code> to unmarshall the serialised data stream.
  This takes a <code>Reader</code> and each read returns an unmarshalled
  data value.
</p>


<p>
  A program to store gob serialised data into a file is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . SaveGob.go" -->
  and to load it back into memory is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . LoadGob.go" -->
</p>

<h3> A client and server </h3>
<p>
  A client to send a person's data and read it back ten times is 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . GobEchoClient.go" -->

  and the corrsponding server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . GobEchoServer.go" -->
</p>


<h2> Encoding binary data as strings </h2>
<p>
Once upon a time, transmtting 8-bit data was problematic.
It was often transmitted over noisy serial lines and could easily become
corrupted. 7-bit data on the other hand could be transmitted more
reliably because the 8th bit could be used as check digit.
For example, in an "even parity" scheme, the check digit would be
set to one or zero to make an even number of 1's in a byte.
This allows detection of errors of a single bit in each byte.
</p>

<p>
ASCII is a 7-bit character set. A number of schemes have been
developed that are more sophisticated than simple parity checking,
but which involve translating 8-bit binary data into 7-bit
ASCII format. Essentially, the 8-bit data is stretched out in some
way over the 7-bit bytes.
</p>

<p>
Binary data transmitted in HTTP responses and requests is often
translated into an ASCII form. This makes it easy to inspect
the HTTP messages with a simple text reader without worrying
about what strange 8-bit bytes might do to your display!
</p>

<p>
One common format is Base64. Go has support for many binary-to-text
formats, including base64.
</p>

<p>
There are two principal functions to use for Base64 encoding and
decoding:
<pre>
<code>
func NewEncoder(enc *Encoding, w io.Writer) io.WriteCloser
func NewDecoder(enc *Encoding, r io.Reader) io.Reader
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
A simple program just to encode and decode a set of eight binary digits is
 <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . Base64.go" -->
