<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
  You can't build a system without some idea of what you want to build.
  And you can't build it if you don't know the environment in which it will work.
  GUI programs are different to batch processing programs; games programs are
  different to business programs; and distributed programs are different to
  standalone programs. They each have their approaches, their common patterns,
  the problems that typically arise and the solutions that are often used.
</p>

<p>
  This chapter covers the highl evel architectural aspects of distributed
  systems. There are many ways of looking at such systems, and many of these
  are dealt with.
</p>

<h2>Protocol Layers</h2> <p>

<p>
  Distributed systems are <em>hard</em>. There are multiple computers
  involved, which have to be connected in some way. Programs have to be
  written to run on each computer in the system and they all have to
  co-operate to get a distributed task done.
</p>

<p>
  The common way to deal with complexity is to break it down into smaller
  and simpler parts. These parts have their own structure, but they also
  have defined means of communicating with other related parts.
  In distributed systems, the parts are called <em>protocol layers</em>
  and they have clearly defined functions. They form a stack, with
  each layer communicating with the layer above and the layer below.
  The communication between layers is defined by protocols.
</p>

<p>
  Network communications requires protocols to cover high-level application
  communication all the way down to wire communication
  and the complexity handled by encapsulation in protocol layers.
</p>

<h3>ISO OSI Protocol</h3> 
<p>
Although it was never properly implemented, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnect)
protocol has been a major influence in ways of talking about and influencing
distributed systems design. It is commonly given in the following figure:
<br/>
<img src="iso.gif"/>
</p>

<h3>OSI layers</h3> 
<p>
  The function of each layer is:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Network layer provides switching and routing technologies
    </li>
    <li>
      Transport layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems
      and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control
    </li>
    <li>
      Session layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between
      applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      Presentation layer provides independance from differences in data
      representation (e.g. encryption)
    </li>
    <li>
      Application layer supports application and end-user processes
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>TCP/IP Protocol</h3> 
<p>
  While the OSI model was being argued, debated, partly implemented
  and fought over, the DARPA internet research project was busy building
  the TCP/IP protocols. These have been immensely succesful and have
  led to The Internet (with capitals). This is a much simpler stack:
<br/>

<img src="tcp_stack.gif"/>
</p>

<h3>Some Alternative Protocols</h3> 
<p>
  Although it almost seems like it, the TCP/IP protocols are not the only ones
  in existence and in the long run may not even be the most successful.
  There are many protocols occupying significant niches, such as
  <ul>
    <li>
      Firewire
    </li>
    <li>
      USB
    </li>
    <li>
      Bluetooth
    <li>
      WiFi
    </li>
  </ul>
  Thre is active work continuing on many other protocols, even quite bizarre
  ones such as those for the "internet in space."
</p>

<p>
  The focus in this book will be on the TCP/IP, but you should be aware of
  these other ones.
</p>

<h2>Networking</h2> <p>
<p>
  A network is a communications system for connecting end systems
  called hosts. The mechanisms of connection might be copper wire,
  ethernet, fibre optic or wireless, but that won't concern us here.
  A local area network (LAN) connects computers that are close together,
  typically belonging to a home, small organisation or part of a larger
  organisation.
</p>

<p>
  A Wide Area Network (WAN) connects computers across a larger physical area,
  such as between cities. There are other types as well, such as MANs
  (Metropolitan Area Network), PANs (Personal Are Networks)
  and even BANs (Body Are Network).
</p>

<p>
  An internet is a connection of two or more distinct networks,
  typically LANs or WANs.
  An intranet is an internet with all networks belonging to a single 
  organisation.
</p>

<p>
  There are significant differences between an internet and an intranet.
  Typically an intranet will be under a single administrative control,
  which will impose a single set of coherent policies. An internet
  on the other hand will not be under the control of a single body,
  and the controls exercised over different parts may not even be
  compatable.
</p>

<p>
  A trivial example of such differences is that an intranet will often
  be restricted to computers by a small number of vendors running a
  standardised version of a particular operating system. On the other
  hand, an internet will often have a smorgasborg of different computers
  and operating systems.
</p>

<p>
  The techniques of this book will be applicable to internets. They will
  also be valid for intranets, but there you will also find specialised,
  non-portable systems.
</p>

<p>
  And then there is the "mother" of all internets: The Internet. This is
  just a very, very large internet that connects us to Google, my computer
  to your computer and so on.
</p>


<h2>Gateways</h2>
<p>
  A gateway is a generic term for an entity used to connect two or
  more networks.
  A repeater operates at the physical level copies the information from
  one subnet to another.
  A bridge operates at the data link layer level and copies frames 
  between networks.
  A router operates at the network level and not only moves information
  between networks but also decides on the route.
</p>

<h2>Packet encapsulation</h2> 
<p>
The communication between layers in either the OSI or the TCP/IP stacks
is done by sending packets of data from one layer to the next, and then
eventually across the network. Each layer has administrative information
that it has to keep about its own layer. It does this by adding header
information to the packet it receives from the layer above, as the
packet passes down. On the receiving side, these headers are removed as 
the packet moves up.
</p>

<p>
For example, the TFP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) moves files from one
computer to another. It uses the UDP protocol on top of the IP protocol,
which may be sent over Ethernet. This looks like:
<br/>
<img src="packets.gif">
<br/>
The packet transmitted over ethernet, is of course the bottom one.
</p>

<h2>Connection Models</h2> 
<p>
In order for two computers to communicate, they must set up a path whereby
they can send at least one message in a session. There are two major models for this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Connection oriented
    </li>
    <li>
      Connectionless
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Connection oriented</h3> 
<p>
  A single connection is established for the session.
  Two-way communications flow along the connection.
  When the session is over, the connection is broken.
  The analogy is to a phone conversation.
  An example is TCP
</p>

<h3>Connectionless</h3> 
<p>
  In a connectionless system, messages are sent independant of each other.
  Ordinary mail is the analogy.
  Connectionless messages may arrive out of order.
  An example is the IP protocol.
  Connection oriented transports may be established on top of connectionless
  ones - TCP over IP.
  Connectionless transports my be established on top of connection
  oriented ones - HTTP over TCP.
</p>

<p>
  There can be variations on these. For example, a session might enforce
  messages arriving, but might not guarantee
  that they arrive in the order sent. However, these two are the most common.
</p>

<h2>Communications Models</h2> 

<h3> Message passing</h3>
<p>
  Some non-procedural languages are built on the principle of <em> message
    passing</em>. Concurrent languages often use such a mechanism, and the
  most well known example is probably the Unix pipeline. The Unix pipeline
  is a pipeline of bytes, but there is not an inherent limitation:
  Microsoft's PowerShell can send objects along its pipelines, and concurrent
  languages such as Parlog could send arbitrary logic data structures
  in messages between concurrent processes.
</p>

<p>
  Message passing is a primitive mechanism for distributed systems. 
  Set up a connection and pump some data down it. At the other end,
  figure out what the message was and respond to it, possibly
  sending messages back. This is illustrated by
  <br/>      
  <img src="msg.gif"/>
</p>

<p>
  Low level event driven systems such as the X Window System function
  in a somewhat similar way: wait for message from a user (mouse clicks, etc),
  decode them and act on them.
</p>

<p>
  Higher level event driven systems assume that this decoding has been done
  by the underlying system and the event is then dispatched to an appropriate
  object such as a ButtonPress handler. This can also be done in distributed
  message passing systems, whereby a message received across the network
  is partly decoded and dispatched
  to an appropriate handler.
</p>

<h3> Remote procedure call </h3>
<p>
  In any system, there is a transfer of information and flow control from
  one part of the system to another. In procedural languages this may
  consist of the procedure call, where information is placed on a call
  stack and then control flow is transferred to another part of the program.
</p>

<p>
  Even with procedure calls, there are variations. The code may be statically
  linked so that control transfers from one part of the program's executable 
  code to another part. Due to the increasing use of library routines, it has
  become commonplace to have such code in dynamic link libraries (DLLs), where control
  transfers to an independent piece of code.
</p>


<p>
  DLLs run in the same machine as the calling code. it is a simple (conceptual) step
  to transfer control to a procedure running in a different machine. The mechanics
  of this are not so simple! However, this model of control has given rise to 
  the "remote procedure call" (RPC) which is discussed in much detail in a later chapter.
  This is illustrated by
  <br/>
  <img src="rpc.gif"/>
</p>

<p>
  There is an historical oddity called the "lightweight remote procedure call"
  invented by Microsoft as they transitioned from 16-bit to 32-bit applications.
  A 16-bit application might need to transfer data to a 32-bit application
  <em> on the same machine</em>. That made it lightweight as there was no
  networking! But it had many of the other issues of RPC systems in data
  representations and conversion.
</p>




<h2>Distributed Computing Models</h2> 
<p>
At the highest lvel, we could consider the equivalence or the non-equivalence
of components of a distributed system.
The most common occurrence is an asymmetric one: a client sends requests to
a server, and the server responds. This is  a <em>client-server</em> system.
</p>

<p>
  If both components are equivalent, both able to initiate and to respond to
messages, then we have a <em>peer-to-peer</em> system. Note that this is 
a logical classification: one peer may be a 16,000 core mainframe, the other
might be a mobile phone. But if both can act similarlym then they are peers.
</p>

<p>
  A third model is the so-called <em>filter</em>. Here one component passes
  information to another which modifies it before passing it to a third.
  This is a fairly common model: for example, 
  the middle component gets information from a database
  as SQl records and transforms it into an HTML table for the third component
  (which might be a browser).
</p>

<p>
  These are illustrated as:
  <br/>
  <img src="peer.gif">
</p>

<h2> Client/Server System</h2> 
<p>
Another view of a client server system is
<br/>
<img src="cs-system.gif">
</p>

<h2> Client/Server Application</h2> 
<p>
And a third view is
<br/>
<img src="cs-application.gif">
</p>

<h2>Server Distribution</h2> <p>
<p>
  A client-server systems need not be simple. The basic model is
  single client, single server
  <br>
  <img src="one-one.gif">
  
  <br/>
  but you can also have
  multiple clients, single server
  <br>
  <img src="many-one.gif">
  <br/>
  In this, the master receives requests and instead of handling them
  one at a time itself, passes them off to other servers to handle.
  This is a common model when concurrent clients are possible.
</p>


<p>
 
  There are also
  single client, multiple servers
  <br>
  <img src="one-many.gif">
  which occurs frequently when a server needs to act as a client to 
  other servers, such as a business logic server getting information
  from a database server. And
  of course, there could be   multiple clients with multiple servers
</p>

<h2>Component Distribution</h2> 
<p>
  A simple but effective way of decomposing many applications is to consider them
  as made up of three parts:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Presentation component
    <li>
      Application logic
    <li>
      Data access
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  The <em>presentation component</em> is responsible for interactions with the user,
  both displaying data and gathering input. it may be a modern GUI interface with
  buttons, lists, menus, etc, or an older command-line style interface, asking 
  questions and getting answers. The details are not important at this level.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>application logic</em> is responsible for intrepreting the users' responses,
  for applying business rules, for preparing queries and managing responses from the
  thir component.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>data access</em> component is responsible for stroing and retrieving data.
  This will often be through a database, but not necessarily.
</p>

<h3>Gartner Classification</h3> 
<p>
  Based on this threefold decomposition of applicaitons, Gartner considered how the
  components might be distributed in a client-server sysem. They came up with five
  models:
  <br/>
<img src="gartner.gif">
</p>

<h3>Example: Distributed Database</h3>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Gartner classification: 1
  </ul>
  
  <img src="gartner1.gif">
  <br/>
  Modern mobile phones make good examples of this: due to limited memory they may
  store a small part of a database locally so that they can usuall respond
  quickly. However, if data is required that is not held locally, then a request
  may be made to a remote database for that additional data.
</p>

<p>
  Google maps forms another good example. Al of the maps reside on Google's servers.
  When one is requested by a user, the "nearby" maps are also downloaded into a small
  database in the browser. When the user moves the map a little bit, the extra bits
  required are already in the local store for quick response.
</p>


<h3>Example: Network File Service</h3> 
<p>
     Gartner classification 2
     allows remote clients acess to a shared file system
     <br/>
  <img src="gartner2.gif">
  <br/>
  There are many examples of scuh systems: NFS, Microsoft shares, DCE, etc
</p>

<h3>Example: Web</h3> 
<p>
      An example of Gartner classification 3 is the Web with Java applets.
      This is a distributed hypertext system, with many additional mechanisms
      <br/>  
  <img src="gartner3.gif">
</p>

<h3>Example: Terminal Emulation</h3> 
<p>
  An example of       Gartner classification 4 is terminal emulation.
  This allows a remote system to act as a normal terminal on a local system.
  <br/>  
  <img src="gartner4.gif">
  <br/>
  Telnet is the most common example of this.
</p>

<h3>Example: Expect</h3> 
<p>
  Expect is a novel illustration of       Gartner classification 5.
  It acts as a wrapper around a classical system such as a command-line interface.
  It builds an    X Window interface around this, so that the user interacts with
  a GUI, and the GUI in turn interacts with the command-line interface.
  <br/>  
  <img src="expect.gif">
</p>

<h3>Example: X Window System</h3>
<p>
  The X Window System itself is an example of       Gartner classification 5.
  An application makes GUI calls such as <code>DrawLine</code>, but these are
  not handled directly but instead passed to an X Window server for rendering.
      This decouples the application view of windowing and the display view of windowing.
  <br/>  
  <img src="gartner5.gif">
</p>



<h3>Three Tier Models</h3> 
<p>
of course, if you have two tiers, then you can have three, four, or more. Some of
the three tier possibilities are shown in this diagram:
<br/>
<img src="threetier.gif">
</p>

<p>
The modern Web is a good example of the rightmost of these. The backend is made
up of a database, often running stored procedures to hold some of the database
logic. The middle tier is an HTTP server such as Apache running PHP scripts
(or Ruby on Rails, or JSP pages, etc). This will manage some of the logic and will
have data such as HTML pages stored locally. The frontend is a browser to display
the pages, under the control of some Javascript. In HTML 5, the frontend may also
have a local database.
</p>

<h3>Fat vs thin</h3> 
<p>
  A common labelling of components is "fat" or "thin". Fat components take 
up lots of memory and do complex processing. Thin components on the other hand,
do little of either. There don't seem to be any "normal" size components, only fat
or thin!
</p>

<p>
Fatness or thinness is a relative concept. Browsers are often laelled as thin
because "all they do is diplay web pages". Firefox on my Linux box takes nearly
1/2 a gigabyte of memory, which I don't regard as small at all!
</p>

<h2>Middleware model</h2> 
<p>
Middleware is teh "glue" connecting components of a distributed system.
The middleware model is
<br/>
<img src="middleware.gif">
</p>

<h2>Middleware</h2> 
<p>
Components of middleware include
  <ul>
    <li>
      The network services include things like TCP/IP
    <li>
      The middleware layer is application-independent s/w using the network
      services
    <li>
      Examples of middleware are: DCE, RPC, Corba
    <li>
      Middleware may only perform one function (such as RPC) or many (such
      as DCE)
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Middleware examples</h3> 
<p>
Examples of middleware include
  <ul>
    <li>
      Primitive services such as terminal emulators, file transfer, email
    <li>
      Basic services such as RPC
    <li>
      Integrated services such as DCE, Network O/S
    <li>
      Distributed object services such as CORBA, OLE/ActiveX
    <li>
      Mobile object services such as RMI, Jini
    </li>
    <li>
      World Wide Web
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Middleware functions</h3> 
<p>
The functions of middleware include
  <ul>
    <li>
      Initiation of processes at different computers
    <li>
      Session management
    <li>
      Directory services to allow clients to locate servers
    <li>
      remote data access
    <li>
      Concurrency control to allow servers to handle multiple clients
    <li>
      Security and integrity
    <li>
      Monitoring
    <li>
      Termination of processes both local and remote
  </ul>
  
<h2>Continuum of Processing</h2> 
<p>
The Gartner model is based on a breakdown of an application into the components
of presentation, application logic and data handling. A finer grained breakdown is
<br/> 
<img src="continuum.gif">


<h2>Points of Failure</h2> 
<p>
Distributed applications run in a complex environment. This makes them much
more prone to failure than standalone applications on a single computer.
The points of failure include
  <ul>
    <li>
      The client side of the application could crash
    <li>
      The client system may have h/w problems
    <li>
      The client's network card could fail
    <li>
      Network contention could cause timeouts
    <li>
      There may be network address conflicts
    <li>
      Network elements such as routers could fail
    <li>
      Transmission errors may lose messages
    <li>
      The client and server versions may be incompatable
    <li>
      The server's network card could fail
    <li>
      The server system may have h/w problems
    <li>
      The server s/w may crash
    <li>
      The server's database may become corrupted
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Applications have to be designed with these possible failures in mind.
Any action performed by one component must be recoverable if failure
occurs in some other part of the system. Techniques such as transactions
and continuous error checking need to be employed to avoid errors.
</p>

<h2>Acceptance Factors</h2> 
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Reliability
    <li>
      Performance
    <li>
      Responsiveness
    <li>
      Scalability
    <li>
      Capacity
    <li>
      Security
  </ul>
</p>

<h2> Transparency </h2>
<p>
  The "holy grails" of distributed systems are to provide the following:
  <ul>
    <li> access transparency </li>
    <li> location transparency </li>
    <li> migration transparency </li>
    <li> replication transparency </li>
    <li> concurrency transparency </li>
    <li> scalability transparency </li>
    <li> performance transparency </li>
    <li> failure transparency </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2> Eight fallacies of distributed computing </h2>
<p>
  Sun Microsystems was a company that performed much of the early work in
  distributed systems, and even had a mantra "The network is the computer."
  Based on their experience over many years a number of the scientists at
  Sun came up with the following list of fallacies commonly assumed:
  <ol>
    <li>
      The network is reliable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Latency is zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bandwidth is infinite.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network is secure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Topology doesn't change.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is one administrator.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transport cost is zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      The network is homogeneous.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Many of these directly impact on network programming. For example,
  the design of most remote procedure call systems is based on the premise
  that the network is reliable so that a remote procedure call will
  behave in the same way as a local call. The fallacies of zero latency
  and infinite bandwidth also lead to assumptions about the time duration 
  of an RPC call being the same as a local call, whereas they are magnitudes
  of order slower.
</p>

<p>
  The recognition of these fallacies led Java's RMI (remote method invocation)
  model to require every RPC call to potentially throw a 
  <code>RemoteException</code>. This forced programmers to at least
  recognise the possibility of network error and to remind them
  that they could not expect the same speeds as local calls.
