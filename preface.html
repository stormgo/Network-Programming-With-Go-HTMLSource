    <h1> Preface </h1>

      Following its beginnings as a DARPA funded research project,
      the internet has exploded in popularity, with services such
      as the Web driving its penetration into every home and business.
      There are a multitude of protocols and services, such as email,
      Bit Torrent, Skype, and Web-based services such as Twitter,
      YouTube and Facebook. There are increasing numbers of mobile
      phone apps using internet technologies to provide hundreds of
      thousands of services.

      In short, it's a great time to be a programmer, and especially
      to be a network applications programmer. With new ideas spilling
      out all the time, someone has to write the code to bring these
      ideas to life.

      But if you are a programmer, how do you get up to speed, and
      which language should you use? The grand daddy of internet
      programming languages is C, 
      and if you are serious about network programming
      then eventually the classic of Unix Network Programming by W.
      Richard Stevens will find its place on your desk. But C is a
      difficult and dangerous language to program in. In fact,
      the phrase "to shoot yourself in the foot" has often been 
      applied as a description of C programming, and has given rise
      to hilarious descriptions of shooting yourself in the foot in a variety
      of different languages (see for example 
      http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Humor/Docs/ShootYourselfInTheFoot.html).

      Novices and even experienced programmers often turn to other
      languages to write programs, and especially network programs.
      But programmers will form impressions about languages which
      can colour how well they will work with those languages.
      For example, I have never liked C++, agreeing with the opinion
      I once heard that it is "a laboratory experiment that escaped."
      Java has lost its way, particularly by introducing generics,
      which spoil it as a teaching language. 
      Perl is good if you like learning a new language every week - the 
      same one.
      Python is fun to program, but unless you test <em>every</em> execution
      path, type errors can easily bite you.

      Google has recently announced a new language, Go. This is intended
      as a systems programming language with the ease of languages
      like Python and the type safety of languages like Java.
      It has introduced a number of features not common in 
      mainstream languages and adopted a structural inheritance model.
      I don't like every feature of Go, but overall have found that it
      is a good and effective language for writing network applications.

      This book is addressed to two audiences: the first is to someone
      reasonably proficient at programming, but lacking experience in
      network applications. For this person, the book works from the
      bottom upwards, from TCP/IP programming up to cloud computing,
      explaining concepts in networking as well as Go programming.
      The second target is for someone already experienced in network
      programming who wants to see how it is done in Go.
      The first person will want to read the book sequentially from the
      beginning, while the second will just dip in, possibly from the
      back to the front.
