Homework
--------

1.
Which computers exist on your local network?
Hint: computers on your local network have
addresses 169.254.167.?. Use a loop from 1..255
to check if the addresses 169.254.167.1..169.254.167.255
exist. Use the InetAddress class

2.
Write a port scanner. This tries to open a socket
on every port from 1..65,000. If a service exists,
the socket can be created. If it cannot, it throws
an exception. Use the Socket class

3.
Change the EchoServer so that when a client socket
is returned from accept(), it prints information
about the client, by using Socket.getHostAddress()
Use the ServerSocket and Socket classes
