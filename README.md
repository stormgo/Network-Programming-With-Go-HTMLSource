# Network Programming with GO

The original source files for the book "Network Programming with Go".
The source files are a mixture of HTML, CSS, Javascript and the Go
programs. The programs are pulled into the Web pages by a server-side
script 'dataprogram.pl' which rewrites funny HTML characters such as '<'
and syntax highlights.
This allows 'live' inclusion of source files into the book.
That file lives in /usr/local/bin but is included in the toplevel directory.

These files directly generate the web pages on 
[jan.newmarch.name/golang](https://jan.newmarch.name/golang).

They are also used to generate the Markdown files on Gitbook for
[Network-Programming-With-Go](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jannewmarch/network-programming-with-go-golang-/details)
