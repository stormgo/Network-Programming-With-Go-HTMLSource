In TLSEchoServer:

In server cert:
	if Time left out, panic
	if Rand left out, hangs

Doc for tls.LoadX509KeyPair should say the certs have to be PEM encoded

c.sendAlert(alertBadCertificate)) occurs 8 times in handshake_client.go.
A detail field of which error caused the BadCert would help debugging.
