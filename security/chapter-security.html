<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Although the internet was originally designed as a system to withstand
  atacks by hostile agents, it developed in a co-operative environment
  of relatively trusted entities. Alas, those days are long gone.
  Spam mail, denial of service attacks, phishing attempts and so on
  are indicative that anyone using the internet does so at their own
  risk.
</p>

<p>
  Applications have to be built to work correctly in
  hostile situations. "correctly" no longer means just getting
  the functional aspects of the program correct, but also means
  ensuring privacy and integrity of data transferred, access
  only to legitimate users and other issues.
</p>

<p>
  This of course makes your programs much more complex. There are
  <em>difficult</em> and <em>subtle</em> computing problems involved 
  in making applications secure. Attempts to do it yourself (such as
  making up your own encryption libraries) are usually doomed
  to failure. Instead, you need to make use of libraries designed
  by security professionals
</p>

<h2> ISO security architecture </h2>
<p>
  The ISO OSI (open systems interconnect) seven-layer model of
  distributed systems is well known and is repeated in this
  figure: <br/>
  <img src="iso.gif"/>
</p>

<p>
  What is less well known is that ISO built a whole series of
  documents upon this architecture. For our purposes here, the most
  important is the ISO Security Architecture model, ISO 7498-2.
</p>

<h3> Functions and levels </h3>

<p>
  The principal functions required of a security system are
  <ul>
    <li>
      Authentication - proof of identity
    </li>
    <li>
      Data integrity  - data is not tampered with
    </li>
    <li>
      Confidentiality - data is not exposed to others
    </li>
    <li>
      Notarization/signature
    </li>
    <li>
      Access control
    </li>
    <li>
      Assurance/availability
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  These are required at the following levels of the OSI stack:

    </li>
    <li>
      Connectionless confidentiality (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Connection integrity without recovery (4, 7)
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>
      Connectionless integrity selective field (7)
    </li>
    <li>
      Non-repudiation at origin (7)
    </li>

<h2> Data integrity </h2>
<p>
  Ensuring data integrity means supplying a means of testing that
  the data has not been tampered with. Usually this is done by
  forming a simple number out of the bytes in the data. This process
  is called <em>hashing</em> and the resulting number is called a
  <em>hash</em> or <em>hash value</em>.
</p>

<p>
  A naive hashing algorithm is just to sum up all the bytes in the
  data. However, this still allows almost any amount of changing the
  data around and still preserving the hash values. For example,
  an attacker could just swap two bytes. This preserves the hash value,
  but could end up with you owing someone $65,536 instead of $256.
</p>

<p>
  Hashing algorithms used for security purposes have to be "strong", 
  so that it is very difficult
  for an attacker to find a different sequence of bytes with the same
  hash value. This makes it hard to modify the data to the attacker's
  purposes. Security researchers are constantly testing hash
  algorithms to see if they can break them - that is, find a simple
  way of coming up with byte sequences to match a hash value.
  They have devised a series of <em>cryptographic</em> hashing
  algorithms which are believed to be strong.
</p>

<p>
  Go has support for several hashing algorithms, including
  MD4, MD5, RIPEMD-160, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512.
  They all follow the same pattern as far as the Go programmer
  is concerned: a function <code>New</code> (or similar) in
  the appropriate package returns a <code>Hash</code> object
  from the <code>hash</code> package.
</p>

<p>
  A <code>Hash</code> has an <code>io.Writer</code>, and you write
  the data to be hashed to this writer. You can query the number
  of bytes in the hash value by <code>Size</code> and the hash
  value by <code>Sum</code>.
</p>

<p>
  A typical case is MD5 hashing. This uses the <code>md5</code>
  package. The hash value is a 16 byte array. This is typically
  printed out in ASCII form as four hexadecimal numbers, each
  made of 4 bytes. A simple program is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . MD5Hash.go" -->
  which prints "b1946ac9 2492d234 7c6235b4 d2611184"
</p>

<p>
  A variation on this is the HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code)
  which adds a key to the hash algorithm. There is little change in using
  this. To use MD5 hashing along with a key, replace the call to
  <code>New</code> by
  <code>
    <pre>
func NewMD5(key []byte) hash.Hash
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<h2> Symmetric key encryption </h2>
<p>
  There are two major mechanisms used for encrypting data.
  The first uses a single key that is the same for both
  encryption and decryption. This key needs to be known to
  both the encrypting and the decrypting agents. How this
  key is transmitted between the agents is not discussed.
</p>

<p>
  As with hashing, there are many encryption algorithms.
  Many are now known to have weaknesses, and in general
  algorithms become weaker over time as computers get
  faster. Go has support for several symmetric key algorithms
  such as Blowfish and DES. 
</p>

<p>
  The algorithms are <em>block</em> algorithms. That is they
  work on blocks of data. If you data is not aligned to the
  block size, then you will have to pad it with extra blanks
  at the end.
</p>

<p>
  Each algorith is represented by a <code>Cipher</code> object.
  This is created by <code>NewCipher</code> in the appropriate
  package, and takes the symmetric key as parameter.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have a cipher, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt
  blocks of data. The blocks have to be 8-bit blocks for Blowfish.
  A program to illustrate this is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . Blowfish.go" -->
</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>
  Blowfish is not in the Go 1 distribution. Instead it is on the 
  http://code.google.com/p/ site. You have to install it by running
  "go get"
  in a directory where you have source that needs to use it.
</p>
</div>

<h2> Public key encryption </h2>

<p>
Public key encryption and decryption requires <em>two</em> keys:
one to encrypt and a second one to decrypt. The encryption key
is usually made public in some way so that anyone can encrypt
messages to you. The decryption key must stay private, otherwise
everyon would be able to decrypt those messages! Public key
systems aer asymmetric, with different keys for different uses.
</p>

<p>
There are many public key encryption systems supported by Go.
A typical one is the RSA scheme.
</p>

<p>
  A program generating RSA private and public keys is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . GenRSAKeys.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  The program also saves the certificates using <code>gob</code>
  serialisation. They can be read back by this program:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . LoadRSAKeys.go" -->
</p>

<h2> X.509 certificates </h2>
<p>
  A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a framework for a collection
  of public keys, along with additional information such as 
  owner name and location, and links between them giving some
  sort of approval mechanism.
</p>

<p>
  The principal PKI in use today is based on X.509 certificates.
  For example, web browsers use them to verify the identity
  of web sites.
</p>

<p>
  An example program to generate a self-signed X.509 certificate
  for my web site and store it in a <code>.cer</code> file is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . GenX509Cert.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  This can then be read back in by
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . LoadX509Cert.go" -->
</p>

<h2> TLS </h2>
<p>
Encryption/decryption schemes are of limited use if you have to do
all the heavy lifting yourself. The most popular mechanism on the internet
to give support for encrypted message passing is currently TLS
(Transport Layer Security) which was formerly SSL 
(Secure Sockets Layer).</p>

<p>
In TLS, a client and a server negotiate identity using X.509 certificates.
One this is complete, a secret key is invented between them, and all
encryption/decryption is done using this key. The negotiation is
relatively slow, but once complete a faster private key mechanism is used.
</p>


<p>
  A server is 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . TLSEchoServer.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  The server works  with the following client: 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . TLSEchoClient.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
Security is a huge area in itself, and in this chapter we have barely touched on it.
However, the major concepts have been covered. What has not been stressed is how
much security needs to be built into the design phase: security as an afterthought
is nearly always a failure.
