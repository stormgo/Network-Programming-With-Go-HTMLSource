<h2> Warning </h2>
<p>
  The netchan package is being reworked. While it was in earlier versions
  of Go, it is not in Go 1. It is available in the <code>old/netchan</code>
  package if you still need it. This chapter describes this old version.
  Do not use it for new code.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  There are many models for sharing information between communicating 
  processes. One of the more elegant is Hoare's concept of
  <em>channels</em>. In this, there is no shared memory, so that none
  of the issues of accessing common memory arise. Instead, one process
  will send a message along a channel to another process. Channels may
  be synchronous, or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered.
</p>

<p>
  Go has channels as first order data types in the language.
  The canonical example of using channels is Erastophene's
  prime sieve: one goroutine generates integers from 2 upwards.
  These are pumped into a series of channels that act as sieves.
  Each filter is distinguished by a different prime, and it
  removes from its stream each number that is divisible by
  its prime. So the '2' goroutine filters out even numbers,
  while the '3' goroutine filters out multiples of 3.
  The first number that comes out of the current set of filters must
  be a new prime, and this is used to start a new filter with a
  new channel.
</p>

<p>
  The efficacy of many thousands of goroutines communicating by
  many thousands of channels depends on how well the implementation
  of these primitives is done. Go is designed to optimise these,
  so this type of program is feasible.
</p>

<p>
  Go also supports distributed channels using the <code>netchan</code>
  package. But network communications are thousands of times slower than
  channel communications on a single computer. Running a sieve on a
  network over TCP would be ludicrously slow. Nevertheless, it gives
  a programming option that may be useful in many situations.
</p>

<p>
  Go's network channel model is somewhat similar in concept to the
  RPC model: a server creates channels and registers them with 
  the network channel API. A client does a lookup for channels
  on a server. At this point both sides have a shared channel
  over which they can communicate. Note that communication is
  one-way: if you want to send information both ways, open
  two channels one for each direction.
</p>

<h2> Channel server </h2>
<p>
  In order to make a channel visible to clients, you need to
  <em>export</em> it. This is done by creating an exporter
  using <code>NewExporter</code> with no parameters.
  The server then calls <code>ListenAndServe</code>
  to lsiten and handle responses. This takes two parameters,
  the first being the underlying transport mechanism such as "tcp"
  and the second being the network listening address (usually
  just a port number.
</p>

<p>
  For each channel, the server creates a normal local channel and then
  calls <code>Export</code> to bind this to the network channel. 
  At the time of export, the direction of communication
  must be specified. Clients search for channels by name, which is a
  string. This is specified to the exporter.
</p>

<p>
  The server then uses the local channels in the normal way, reading or
  writing on them. We illustrate with an "echo" server which
  reads lines and sends them back. It needs two channels for this.
  The channel that the client writes to we name "echo-out".
  On the server side this is a read channel. Similarly, the channel
  that the client reads from we call "echo-in", which is a write
  channel to the server.
</p>

<p>
  The server program is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoServer.go" -->
</p>

<p>
<em>Note: at the time of writing, the server will sometimes fail with an
error message "netchan export: error encoding client response". This is
logged as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=1805">
Issue 1805</a></em>
</p>


<h2> Channel client </h2>
<p>
  In order to find an exported channel, the client must <em>import</em>
  it. This is created using <code>Import</code> which takes a
  protocol and a network service address of "host:port". This is
  then used to import a network channel by name and bind it to a local channel.
  Note that channel variables
  are <em>references</em>, so you do not need to pass their
  addresses to functions that change them.
</p>

<p>
  The following client gets two channels to and from the echo server,
  and then writes and reads ten messages:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoClient.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Handling Timeouts</h2>
<p>
Because these channels use the network, there is alwasy the possibility of
network errors leading to timeouts.
Andrew Gerrand points out a solution using
<a href="http://blog.golang.org/2010/09/go-concurrency-patterns-timing-out-and.html">
timeouts</a>:
"[Set up a timeout channel.] 
We can then use a select statement to receive from either ch or timeout. 
If nothing arrives on ch after one second, the timeout case is selected 
and the attempt to read from ch is abandoned."
<pre>
<code>
timeout := make(chan bool, 1)
go func() {
    time.Sleep(1e9) // one second
    timeout &lt;- true
}()

select {
case &lt- ch:
    // a read from ch has occurred
case &lt;- timeout:
    // the read from ch has timed out
}
</code>
</pre>

<h2> Channels of channels </h2>
<p>
  The online Go tutorial at http://golang.org/doc/go_tutorial.html has 
  an example of multiplexing, where channels of channels are used.
  The idea is that instread of sharing one channel, a new communicator
  is given their own channel to have a privagye conversation. That is,
  a client is sent a channel from a server through a shared channel,
  and uses that private channel.
</p>

<p>
  This doesn't work directly with network channels: a channel cannot be
  sent over a network channel. So we have to be a little more indirect.
  Each time a client connects to a server, the server builds new network
  channels and exports them with new names. Then it sends the 
  <em>names</em> of these new channels to the client which imports
  them. It uses these new channels for communicaiton.
</p>

<p>
  A server is 
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoChanServer.go" -->
  and a client is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . EchoChanClient.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
Network channels are a distributed analogue of local channels.
They behave approximately the same, but due to limitations
of the model some things have to be done a little differently.
