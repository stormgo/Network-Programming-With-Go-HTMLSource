<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Socket and HTTP programming use a message-passing paradigm.
  A client sends a message to a server which usually sends
  a message back. Both sides ae responsible for creating messages
  in a format understood by both sides, and in reading the
  data out of those messages.
</p>

<p>
  However, most standalone applications do not make so much
  use of message passing techniques. Generally the preferred
  mechanism is that of the <code>function</code> (or method or
  procedure) call. In this style, a program will call a function
  with a list of parameters, and on completion of the function
  call will have a set of return values. These values may
  be the function value, or if addresses have been passed as
  parameters then the contents of those addresses might have been
  changed.
</p>

<p>
  The remote procedure call is an attempt to bring this style
  of programming into the network world. Thus a client will make
  what looks to it like a normal procedure call. The client-side
  will package this into a network message and transfer it to the
  server. The server will unpack this and turn it back into a
  procedure call on the server side. The results of this call
  will be packaged up for return to the client.
</p>

<p>
  Diagrammatically it looks like
  <br>
  <img src="rpc_stub.png">
  <br>
  where the steps are 
  <ol>
    <li>The client calls the local stub procedure. 
      The stub packages up the parameters 
      into a network message. This is called <i>marshalling</i>.
    </li>
    <li>Networking functions in the O/S kernel are called by 
      the stub to send the message.
    </li>
    <li>The kernel sends the message(s) to the remote system. 
      This may be connection-oriented 
      or connectionless.
    </li>
    <li>A server stub unmarshals the arguments from the network message.
    </li>
    <li>The server stub executes a local procedure call.
    </li>
    <li>The procedure completes, returning execution to the server stub.
    </li>
    <li>The server stub marshals the return values into a network message.
    </li>
    <li>The return messages are sent back.
    </li>
    <li>The client stub reads the messages using the network functions.
    </li>
    <li>The message is unmarshalled. and the return values are 
      set on the stack for 
      the local process.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  There are two common styles for implementing RPC.
  The first is typified by Sun's RPC/ONC and by CORBA.
  In this, a specification of the service is given in some
  abstract language such as CORBA IDL (interface definition
  language). This is then compiled into code for the client
  and for the server. The client then writes a normal
  program containing calls to a procedure/function/method
  which is linked to the generated client-side code.
  The server-side code is actually a server itself,
  which is linked to the procedure implementation that
  you write.
</p>

<p>
  In this way, the client-side code is almost identical in 
  appearance to a normal procedure call. Generally there is
  a little extra code to locate the server. In Sun's ONC,
  the address of the server must be known; in CORBA a naming
  service is called to find the address of the server;
  In Java RMI, the IDL is Java itself and a naming service
  is used to find the address of the service.
</p>

<p>
  In the second style, you have to make use of a special
  client API. You hand the function name and its parameters
  to this library on the client side. On the server side,
  you have to explicitly write the server yourself, as well
  as the remote procedure implementation. 
</p>

<p>
  This approach is used by many RPC systems, such as Web Services.
  It is also the approach used by Go's RPC.
</p>

<h2> Go RPC </h2>
<p>
  Go's RPC is so far unique to Go. It is different to the other RPC
  systems, so a Go client will only talk to a Go server.
  It uses the Gob serialisation system discussed in chapter X,
  which defines the data types which can be used.
</p>

<p>
  RPC systems generally make some restrictions on the functions that
  can be called across the network. This is so that the RPC system
  can properly determine what are value arguments to be sent, what
  are reference arguments to receive answers, and how to signal errors.
</p>

<p>
  In Go, the restriction is that 
  <ul>
    <li>
      the function must be public
      (begin with a capital letter);
    </li>
    <li>
      have exactly two arguments, the first 
      is a pointer to value data to be received by the function 
      from the client, 
      and the second is a pointer to hold the answers to be returned 
      to the client; and
    </li>
    <li>
      have a return value of type <code>error</code>
    </li>
  </ul>
  For example, a valid function is
  <code>
    <pre>
      F(&amp;T1, &amp;T2) error
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  The restriction on arguments means that you typically have to define
  a structure type. Go's RPC uses the <code>gob</code> package for
  marshalling and unmarshalling data, so the argument types have to
  follow the rules of <code>gob</code> as discussed in an earlier
  chapter.
</p>

<p>
  We shall follow the example given in the Go documentation, as this
  illustrates the important points. The server performs two operations
  which are trivial - they do not require the "grunt" of RPC, but
  are simple to understand. The two operations are to multiply two
  integers, and the second is to find the quotient and remainder after
  dividing the first by the second. 
</p>

<p>
  The two values to be manipulated are given in a structure:
  <code>
    <pre>
type Values struct {
    X, Y int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
  The sum is just an <code>int</code>, while the quotient/remainder
  is another structure
  <code>
    <pre>
type Quotient struct {
    Quo, Rem int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  We will have two functions, multiply and divide to be callable on the
  RPC server. These functions will need to be registered with the RPC
  system. The function <code>Register</code> takes a single
  parameter, which is an interface. So we need a type with these
  two functions:
  <code>
    <pre>
type Arith int

func (t *Arith) Multiply(args *Args, reply *int) error {
	*reply = args.A * args.B
	return nil
}

func (t *Arith) Divide(args *Args, quo *Quotient) error {
	if args.B == 0 {
		return error.String("divide by zero")
	}
	quo.Quo = args.A / args.B
	quo.Rem = args.A % args.B
	return nil
}
    </pre>
  </code>
  The underlying type of <code>Arith</code> is given as <code>int</code>.
  That doesn't matter - any type could have done.
</p>

<p>
  An object of this type can now be registered using
  <code>Register</code>, and then its methods
  can be called by the RPC system.
</p>

<h3> HTTP RPC Server </h3>

<p>
  Any RPC needs a transport mechanism to get messages across the
  network. Go can use HTTP or TCP. The advantage of the HTTP
  mechanism is that it
  can leverage off the HTTP suport library. You need to add an RPC
  handler to the HTTP layer which is done using <code>HandleHTTP</code>
  and then start an HTTP server. The complete code is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ArithServer.go" -->
</p>

<h3> HTTP RPC client </h3>
<p>
  The client needs to set up an HTTP connection to the RPC server.
  It needs to prepare a structure with the values to be sent, and
  the address of a variable to store the results in.
  Then it can make a <code>Call</code> with arguments:
  <ul>
    <li>
      The name of the remote function to execute
    </li>
    <li>
      The values to be sent
    </li>
    <li>
      The address of a variable to store the result in
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  A client that calls both functions of the arithmetic server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ArithClient.go" -->
</p>

<h3> TCP RPC server </h3>
<p>
  A version of the server that uses TCP sockets is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . TCPArithServer.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  Note that the call to <code>Accept</code> is blocking, and just
  handles client connections.
  If the server wishes to do other work as well, it should call
  this in a goroutine.
</p>

<h3> TCP RPC client </h3>
<p>
  A client that uses the TCP server and calls both functions of the arithmetic server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . TCPArithClient.go" -->
</p>


<h3> Matching values </h3>
<p>
  We note that the types of the value arguments are not the same on 
  the client and server. In the server, we have used <code>Values</code>
  while in the client we used <code>Args</code>. That doesn't matter,
  as we are following the rules of <code>gob</code> serialisation,
  and the names an types of the two structures' fields match.
  Better programming practise would say that the names should be 
  the same!
</p>

<p>
  However, this does point out a possible trap in using Go RPC.
  If we change the structure in the client to be, say,
  <code>
    <pre>
type Values struct {
	C, B int
}
    </pre>
  </code>
  then <code>gob</code> has no problems: on the server-side
  the unmarshalling will ignore the value of <code>C</code>
  given by the client, and use the default zero value for
  <code>A</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Using Go RPC will require a rigid enforcement of the stability
  of field names and types by the programmer. 
  We note that there is no version 
  control mechanism to do this, and no mechanism in <code>gob</code>
  to signal any possible mismatches.
</p>

<h2> JSON </h2>
<p>
  This section adds nothing new to the earlier concepts.
  It just uses a different "wire" format for the data,
  JSON instead of <code>gob</code>.
  As such, clients or servers could be written in other
  languasge that understand sockets and JSON.
</p>

<h3> JSON RPC client </h3>
<p>
  A client that calls both functions of the arithmetic server is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . JSONArithClient.go" -->
</p>

<h3> JSON RPC server </h3>
<p>
  A version of the server that uses JSON encoding is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . JSONArithServer.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
RPC is a popular means of distributing applications.
Several ways of doing it have been presented here.
What is missing from Go is support for the currently fashionable
(but extremely badly enginereed) SOAP RPC mechanism.
