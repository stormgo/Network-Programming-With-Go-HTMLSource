<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web is a major distributed system, with millions of
users. A site may become a Web host by running an HTTP server.
While Web clients are typically users with a browser,
there are many other "user agents" such as web spiders, 
web application clients and so on.
</p>

<p>
The Web is built on top of the HTTP (Hyper-Text Transport
Protocol) which is layered on top of TCP. HTTP has been through
three publically available versions, but the latest - version 1.1 -
is now the most commonly used.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter we give an overview of HTTP, followed by the Go
APIs to manage HTTP connections.
</p>

<h2> Overview of HTTP </h2>

<h3> URLs and resources </h3>
<p>
  URLs specify the location of a <em>resource</em>. 
  A resource is often a static file, such as an HTML document,
  an image, or a sound file. But increasingly, it may be a
  dynamically generated object, perhaps based on information
  stored in a database.
</p>

<p>
  When a user agent requests a resource,
  what is returned is not the resource itself, but some
  <em> representation</em> of that resource.
  For example, if the resource is a static file,
  then what is sent to the user agent is a copy of the file.
</p>

<p>
  Multiple URLs may point to the same resource, and an HTTP
  server will return appropriate representations of the resource
  for each URL. For example, an company might make product
  information available both internally and externally
  using different URLs for the same product.
  The internal representation of the product might include information
  such as internal contact officers for the product,
  while the external representation might include the location
  of stores selling the product.
</p>

<p>
  This view of resources means that the HTTP protocol can be fairly
  simple and straightforward, while an HTTP server can be arbitrarily
  complex. HTTP has to deliver requests from user agents to servers
  and return a byte stream, while a server might have to do any 
  amount of processing of the request.
</p>

<h3> HTTP characteristics </h3>
<p>
HTTP is a stateless, connectionless, reliable protocol. 
In the simplest form, each request 
from a user agent is handled reliably and then the connection is broken.
Each request involves a separate TCP connection, so if many 
reources are required (such as images embedded in an HTML page)
then many TCP connections have to be set up and torn down in a
short space of time.
</p>

<p>
  Thera are many optimisations in HTTP which add complexity to
  the simple structure, in order to create a more efficient and
  reliable protocol.
</p>

<h3>Versions</h3>

<p>
  There are 3 versions of HTTP
  <ul>
    <li> Version 0.9 - totally obsolete
    </li>
    <li> Version 1.0 - almost obsolete
    </li>
    <li> Version 1.1 - current
    </li>
  </ul>
  Each version must understand requests and responses of earlier versions.
</p>

<h3> HTTP 0.9 </h3>

<h4>Request format </h4>

<p>
  <PRE>
Request = Simple-Request

Simple-Request = "GET" SP Request-URI CRLF
  </PRE>
</p>

<H4>Response format</H4>
<p>
  A response is of the form
  <PRE>
Response = Simple-Response

Simple-Response = [Entity-Body]
  </PRE>
</p>

<h3> HTTP 1.0 </h3>

<p>
This version added much more information to the requests and responses.
Rather than "grow" the 0.9 format, it was just left alongside the new
version.
</p>


<H4>Request format</H4>
<p>
The format of requests from client to server is
<PRE>
Request = Simple-Request | Full-Request

Simple-Request = "GET" SP Request-URI CRLF

Full-Request = Request-Line
		*(General-Header
		| Request-Header
		| Entity-Header)
		CRLF
		[Entity-Body]
</PRE>
A Simple-Request is an HTTP/0.9 request and must be replied to by a
Simple-Response.
</p>

 <P>
A Request-Line has format
<PRE>
Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
</PRE>

where
<PRE>
Method = "GET" | "HEAD" | POST |
	 extension-method
</PRE>
e.g.
<PRE>
GET http://jan.newmarch.name/index.html HTTP/1.0
</PRE>
 </P>

<H4>Response format</H4>

<p>
A response is of the form
<PRE>
Response = Simple-Response | Full-Response

Simple-Response = [Entity-Body]

Full-Response = Status-Line
		*(General-Header 
		| Response-Header
		| Entity-Header)
		CRLF
		[Entity-Body]
</PRE>
</p>

 <P>
The Status-Line gives information about the fate of the request:
<PRE>
Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
</PRE>
e.g.
<PRE>
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
</PRE>

The codes are
<PRE>
Status-Code =	  "200" ; OK
		| "201" ; Created
		| "202" ; Accepted
		| "204" ; No Content
		| "301" ; Moved permanently
		| "302" ; Moved temporarily
		| "304" ; Not modified
		| "400" ; Bad request
		| "401" ; Unauthorised
		| "403" ; Forbidden
		| "404" ; Not found
		| "500" ; Internal server error
		| "501" ; Not implemented
		| "502" ; Bad gateway
		| "503" | Service unavailable
		| extension-code
</PRE>
 </P>

 <P>
The Entity-Header contains useful information about the Entity-Body to
follow
<PRE>
Entity-Header =	Allow
		| Content-Encoding
		| Content-Length
		| Content-Type
		| Expires
		| Last-Modified
		| extension-header
</PRE>

For example
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 29 Aug 2003 00:59:56 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0.40 (Unix)
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 1595
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
</pre>
 </P>

<h3>HTTP 1.1</h3>

<p>
HTTP 1.1 fixes many problems with HTTP 1.0, but is more complex because
of it.
This version is done by extending or refining
the options available to HTTP 1.0.
e.g.
<ul>
  <li>
      there are more commands such as TRACE and CONNECT
  </li>
  <li>
      you should use absolute URLs, particularly for connecting by
      proxies e.g
      <code><pre>
      GET http://www.w3.org/index.html HTTP/1.1
      </pre></code>
  </li>
  <li>
      there are more attributes such as If-Modified-Since, also for
      use by proxies
  </li>
	  
</ul>
The changes include 
<ul>
  <li>
    hostname identification (allows virtual hosts)
  <li>
    content negotiation (multiple languages)
  <li>
    persistent connections (reduces TCP overheads - this is very messy)
  <li>
    chunked transfers
  <li>
    byte ranges (request parts of documents)
  <li>
    proxy support
</ul>
The 0.9 protocol took one page. The 1.0 protocol was described in about 20 pages. 1.1 takes 120 pages.
</p>

<h2> Simple user-agents </h2>

<p>
  User agents such as browsers make requests and get responses. The
  response type is
  <code>
    <pre>
type Response struct {
    Status     string // e.g. "200 OK"
    StatusCode int    // e.g. 200
    Proto      string // e.g. "HTTP/1.0"
    ProtoMajor int    // e.g. 1
    ProtoMinor int    // e.g. 0

    RequestMethod string // e.g. "HEAD", "CONNECT", "GET", etc.

    Header map[string]string

    Body io.ReadCloser

    ContentLength int64

    TransferEncoding []string

    Close bool

    Trailer map[string]string
}
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  We shall examine this data structure through examples.
  The simplest request is from a user agent is "HEAD"
  which asks for information about a resource and its HTTP
  server. The function
  <code>
    <pre>
func Head(url string) (r *Response, err os.Error)
    </pre>
  </code>
  can be used to make this query.
</p>

<p>
  The status of the response is in the response field
  <code>Status</code>, while the field <code>Header</code>
  is a map of the header fields in the HTTP response.
  A program to make this request and display the results is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . Head.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  When run against a resource as in <code>Head http://www.golang.com/</code>
  it prints something like
  <code>
    <pre>
200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 05:34:29 GMT
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
Expires: Tue, 14 Sep 2010 06:34:29 GMT
Server: Google Frontend
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Usually, we are want to retrieve a resource rather than just get
  information about it. The "GET" request will do this, and this
  can be done using
  <code>
    <pre>
func Get(url string) (r *Response, finalURL string, err os.Error)
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  The content of the response is in the response field 
  <code>Body</code> which is of type <code>io.ReadCloser</code>. 
  We can print the content
  to the screen with the following program
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . Get.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  Note that there are important character set issues of the type
  discussed in the previous chapter. The server will deliver the
  content using some character set encoding, and possibly some
  transfer encoding. Usually this is a matter of negotiation
  between user agent and server, but the simple <code>Get</code>
  command that we are using does not include the user agent
  component of the negotiation. So the server can send whatever
  character encoding it wishes.
</p>

<p>
  At the time of first writing, I was in China.
  When I tried this program on <code>www.google.com</code>, Google's server tried
  to be helpful by guessing my location and sending me the text
  in the Chinese character set Big5! How to tell the server what
  character encoding is okay for me is discussed later.
</p>

<h2> Configuring HTTP requests </h2>
<p>
  Go also supplies a lower-level interface for user agents to communicate
  with HTTP servers. As you might expect, not only does it give you
  more control over the client requests, but requires you to spend more
  effort in building the requests. However, there is only a small increase.
</p>

<p>
  The data type used to build requests is the type <code>Request</code>.
  This is a complex type, and is given in the Go documentation as
  <code>
    <pre>
type Request struct {
    Method     string // GET, POST, PUT, etc.
    RawURL     string // The raw URL given in the request.
    URL        *URL   // Parsed URL.
    Proto      string // "HTTP/1.0"
    ProtoMajor int    // 1
    ProtoMinor int    // 0


    // A header maps request lines to their values.
    // If the header says
    //
    //	accept-encoding: gzip, deflate
    //	Accept-Language: en-us
    //	Connection: keep-alive
    //
    // then
    //
    //	Header = map[string]string{
    //		"Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
    //		"Accept-Language": "en-us",
    //		"Connection": "keep-alive",
    //	}
    //
    // HTTP defines that header names are case-insensitive.
    // The request parser implements this by canonicalizing the
    // name, making the first character and any characters
    // following a hyphen uppercase and the rest lowercase.
    Header map[string]string

    // The message body.
    Body io.ReadCloser

    // ContentLength records the length of the associated content.
    // The value -1 indicates that the length is unknown.
    // Values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may be read from Body.
    ContentLength int64

    // TransferEncoding lists the transfer encodings from outermost to innermost.
    // An empty list denotes the "identity" encoding.
    TransferEncoding []string

    // Whether to close the connection after replying to this request.
    Close bool

    // The host on which the URL is sought.
    // Per RFC 2616, this is either the value of the Host: header
    // or the host name given in the URL itself.
    Host string

    // The referring URL, if sent in the request.
    //
    // Referer is misspelled as in the request itself,
    // a mistake from the earliest days of HTTP.
    // This value can also be fetched from the Header map
    // as Header["Referer"]; the benefit of making it
    // available as a structure field is that the compiler
    // can diagnose programs that use the alternate
    // (correct English) spelling req.Referrer but cannot
    // diagnose programs that use Header["Referrer"].
    Referer string

    // The User-Agent: header string, if sent in the request.
    UserAgent string

    // The parsed form. Only available after ParseForm is called.
    Form map[string][]string

    // Trailer maps trailer keys to values.  Like for Header, if the
    // response has multiple trailer lines with the same key, they will be
    // concatenated, delimited by commas.
    Trailer map[string]string
}
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot of information that can be stored in a request.
  You do not need to fill in all fields, only those of interest.
  The simplest way to create a request with default values is by
  for example
  <pre>
    <code>
request, err := http.NewRequest("GET", url.String(), nil)
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  Once a request has been created, you can modify fields. For example,
  to specify that you only wish to receive UTF-8,
  add an "Accept-Charset" field to a request by
  <pre>
    <code>
request.Header.Add("Accept-Charset", "UTF-8;q=1, ISO-8859-1;q=0")
    </code>
  </pre>
  (Note that the default set ISO-8859-1 always gets a value of one
  unless mentioned explicitly in the list.).
</p>

<p>
  A client setting a charset request is simple by the above.
  But there is some confusion about what happens with the server's return
  value of a charset. The returned resource <em>should</em> have a 
  <code>Content-Type</code> which will specify the media type
  of the content such as <code>text/html</code>. If appropriate
  the media type should state the charset, such as
  <code> text/html; charset=UTF-8</code>. If there is no charset
  specification, then according to the HTTP specification it should
  be treated as the default ISO8859-1 charset. But the HTML 4 specification
  states that since many servers don't conform to this, then you can't
  make any assumptions.
</p>

<p>
  If there is a charset specified in the server's <code>Content-Type</code>,
  then assume it is correct. if there is none specified, since 50% of
  pages are in UTF-8 and 20% are in ASCII then it is safe to assume UTF-8.
  Only 30% of pages may be wrong :-(.
</p>

<h2> The Client object </h2>
<p>
  To send a request to a server and get a reply, the convenience object
  <code>Client</code> is the easiest way. This object can manage multiple
  requests and will look after issues such as whether the server keeps
  the TCP connection alive, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  This is illustrated in the following
  program
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ClientGet.go" -->
</p>

<h2> Proxy handling </h2>

<h3> Simple proxy </h3>
<p>
  HTTP 1.1 laid out how HTTP should work through a proxy. 
  A "GET" request should be made to a proxy. However, the URL
  requested should be the full URL of the destination. 
  In addition the HTTP header should contain a "Host" field, set to the proxy.
  As long as the proxy is configured to pass such requests through,
  then that is all that needs to be done.
</p>

<p>
  Go considers this to be part of the HTTP transport layer. To manage
  this it has a class <code>Transport</code>. This contains a field
  which can be set to a <em>function</em> that returns a URL for a proxy.
  If we have a URL as a string for the proxy, the appropriate transport
  object is created and then given to a client object by
  <pre>
    <code>
proxyURL, err := url.Parse(proxyString)
transport := &http.Transport{Proxy: http.ProxyURL(proxyURL)}
client := &http.Client{Transport: transport}
    </code>
  </pre>
  The client can then continue as before.
</p>

<p>
  The following program illustrates this:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ProxyGet.go" -->
</p>

<p>
  If you have a proxy at, say, XYZ.com on port 8080, test this by
  <pre>
    <code>
go run ProxyGet.go http://XYZ.com:8080/ http://www.google.com
    </code>
  </pre>
  If you don't have a suitable proxy to test this, then download 
  and install the
  Squid proxy to your own computer.
</p>

<p>
  The above program used a known proxy passed as an argument to the program.
  There are many ways in which proxies can be made known to applications.
  Most browsers have a configuration menu in which you can enter proxy
  information: such information is not available to a Go application.
  Some applications may get proxy information from an <code>autoproxy.pac</code> 
  file somewhere
  in your network: Go does not (yet) know how to parse these JavaScript files and so
  cannot use them. Linux systems using Gnome have a configuration system called
  <code>gconf</code> in which proxy information can be stored: Go cannot access this.
  <em>But</em> it can find proxy information if it is set in operating system
  environment variables such as HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy using the function
  <pre>
    <code>
func ProxyFromEnvironment(req *Request) (*url.URL, error)
    </code>
  </pre>
  If your programs are running in such an environment you can use this function
  instead of having to explicitly know the proxy parameters.
</p>


<h3> Authenticating proxy </h3>
<p>
  Some proxies will require authentication, by a user name and
  password in order to pass requests. A common scheme is
  "basic authentication" in which the user name and password
  are concatenated into a string "user:password" and then
  BASE64 encoded. This is then given to the proxy by the
  HTTP request header "Proxy-Authorisation" with the flag that
  it is the basic authentication
</p>

<p>
  The following program illlustrates this, adding the Proxy-Authentication
  header to the previous proxy program:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ProxyAuthGet.go" -->
</p>


<h2> HTTPS connections by clients </h2>
<p>
  For secure, encrypted connections, HTTP uses TLS which is described in 
  the chapter on security. The protocol of HTTP+TLS is called 
  HTTPS and uses https:// urls instead of http:// urls.
</p>
<p> 
  Servers are required to return valid X.509 certificates before a
  client will accept data from them. If the certificate is valid,
  then Go handles everything under the hood and the clients given
  previously run okay with https URLs.
</p>
<p>
  Many sites have invalid certificates. They may have expired, they may
  be self-signed instead of by a recognised Certificate Authority
  or they may just have errors (such as having an incorrect server name).
  Browsers such as Firefox put a big warning notice with a
  "Get me out of here!" button, but you can carry on at your risk - 
  which many people do.
</p>
<p>
  Go presently bails out when it encounters certificate errors.
  There is cautious support for carrying on but I haven't got it working yet.
  So there is no current example for "carrying on in the face of adversity :-)".
  Maybe later.
</p>
  


<h2> Servers </h2>

<p>
  The other side to building a client is a Web server handling HTTP
  requests. The simplest - and earliest - servers just returned
  copies of files. However, any URL can now trigger an arbitrary
  computation in current servers.
</p>

<h3> File server </h3>
<p>
  We start with a basic file server. Go supplies a 
  <code>multi-plexer</code>, that is, an object that will read
  and interpret requests. It hands out requests to <code>handlers</code>
  which run in their own thread. Thus much of the work of reading
  HTTP requests, decoding them and branching to suitable functions
  in their own thread is done for us.
</p>

<p>
  For a file server, Go also gives a <code>FileServer</code>
  object which knows how to deliver files from the local file
  system. It takes a "root" directory which is the top of a
  file tree in the local system, and a pattern to match URLs
  against. The simplest pattern is "/" which is the top of any
  URL. This will match all URLs.
</p>

<p>
  An HTTP server delivering files from the local file system is almost
  embarrassingly trivial given these objects. It is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . FileServer.go" -->
  This server even delivers "404 not found" messages for requests
  for file resources that don't exist!
</p>

<h3> Handler functions </h3>
<p>
  In this last program, the handler was given in the second argument
  to <code>ListenAndServe</code>.
  Any number of handlers can be
  registered first by calls to <code>Handle</code> or
  <code>handleFunc</code>, with signatures
  <code>
    <pre>
func Handle(pattern string, handler Handler)
func HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(*Conn, *Request))
    </pre>
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  The second argument to <code>HandleAndServe</code> could be 
  <code>nil</code>, and then calls are dispatched to all registered
  handlers. Each handler should have a different URL pattern.
  For example, the file handler might have URL pattern "/"
  while a function handler might have URL pattern "/cgi-bin".
  A more specific pattern takes precedence over a more general
  pattern.
</p>

<p>
  Common CGI programs are <code>test-cgi</code> (written in the shell)
  or <code>printenv</code> (written in Perl) which print the values
  of the environment variables. A handler can be written to
  work in a similar manner.
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PrintEnv.go" -->
  <em> Note: for simplicity this program does not deliver well-formed HTML.
    It is missing html, head and body tags</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Using the <code>cgi-bin</code> directory in this program is a bit 
  cheeky: it doesn't call an external program like CGI scripts do.
  It just calls a Go function. Go does have the ability to call external
  programs using <code>os.ForkExec</code>, but does not yet have
  support for dynamically linkable modules like Apache's 
  <code>mod_perl</code>
</p>

<h3> Bypassing the default multiplexer </h3>
<p>
  HTTP requests received by a Go server are usually handled by a multiplexer
  the examines the path in the HTTP request and calls the appropriate file handler, etc.
  You can  define your own handlers. These can either be registered with the default
  multiplexer by calling <code>http.HandleFunc</code> which takes a pattern and
  a function. The functions such as <code>ListenAndServe</code> then take a <code>nil</code>
  handler function. This was done in the last example.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to take over the multiplexer role then you can give a non-zero function
  as the handler function. This function will then be totally responsible for
  managing the requests and responses.
</p>

<p>
  The following example is trivial, but illustrates the use of this:
  the multiplexer function simply returns a "204 No content" for <em>all</em>
  requests:
    <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . ServerHandler.go" -->
    Arbitrarily complex behaviour can be built, of course.
</p>


<!--
<h2> Low-level servers </h2>
<p>
  Go also supplies a lower-level interface for servers. Again, this
  means that as the programmer you have to do more work.
  You first make a TCP server, and then wrap a <code>ServerConn</code>
  around it. Then you read <code>Request</code>'s and write
  <code>Response</code>'s.
</p>

<h3> Basic server </h3>
<p>
  The simplest response is to return a "204 No Content".
  The following server reads requests and dumps them to standard
  output while returning a 204. More complex handling could be done:
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . LowLevelServer.go"
</p>

<h3> Persistent connections </h3>
<p>
Most web pages now are a mix of HTML, images, cascading style sheets and
JavaScript libraries. Fetching a "single" page often means opening
up many HTTP connections to fetch each one of the components
separately. This involves setting up  a TCP connection
for each one, and then sending a single HTTP request/response pair over
each connection, and then tearing down the TCP connection.
This is clearly wasteful.
</p>

<p>
One of the optimisations in HTTP 1.1 was to introduce <em>persistent</em>
connections. That is, a single TCP connection wold be opened up for,
say, about 30 seconds and then a set of HTTP requests/responses would
be sent over this single connection. Note that these persistent connections
are not available if either the client or server declare themselves
to be HTTP 1.0 or HTTP 1.0: the optimisation can only work between
HTTP 1.1 clients and servers.
</p>

<p>
The low level API can give you control over this as you can manage
the <code>ClientConn</code> and <code>ServerConn</code> yourself.
Multiple reads and writes can be done on each of these connections.
</p>

<p>
The Go library ensures that all outgoing requests use HTTP 1.1, so
user agents are already set up with the correct version of the HTTP protocol.
A <code>Request</code> has the field <code>Close</code> which defaults
to close, so that clients will signal that they want to keep connections
open. Nevertheless, there is no harm in setting these explicitly as we
do inthe following code.
</p>

<p>
In the client, we create a  client connection just once and then
perform a series of reads and writes on that connection. On each
of these reads and writes we exanine the error return. If it is
<code>ErrPersistEOF</code> then the connection has been closed by the
other side. This is not an error. Other values are still errors though.
The client is
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersistentClient.go"
</p>

<p>
In a more realistic case, the returned resource would be examined
to see if it has more url's to fetch and they could be added to
a queue of urls. The logic might look 
something like
<pre>
<code>
enqueue initial url
while queue is not empty
    create client connection
    while queue is not empty 
        dequeue url
        get resource, break on close of connection
        enqueue new urls from resource
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The server would listen for TCP connections on its HTTP port.
When each one arrives it would call a handler (as a go routine)
which will read requests until the connection is closed by the
client. A server won't wish to keep a connection open indefinitely.
The following server closes the connection after 10 seconds,
but other behaviour is possible.
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . PersistentServer.go" 
</p>


<h2> HTTPS </h2>
<p>
  For secure, encrypted connections, HTTP uses TLS which is described
  in the chapter on security. The protocol of HTTP+TLS is called
  HTTPS and uses http:// urls instead of http:// urls.
</p>

<p>
  For a server to use HTTPS, it needs an X.509 certificate and a private
  key file for that certificate. Go at present requires that these be
  PEM-encoded. Then the HTTP function <code>ListenAndServe</code> is
  replaced by the HTTPS (HTTP+TLS) function <code>ListenAndServeTLS</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The file server program given earlier can be written as an HTTPS server
  as
  <!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/dataprogram.pl . HTTPSFileServer.go"
  This server is accessed by e.g. 
  <code>https://localhost:8000/index.html</code>
</p>

<p>
  If you want a server that supports both HTTP and HTTPs, run
  each listener in its own goroutine.
</p>
-->

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p>
Go has extensive support for HTTP. This is not surprising, since Go
was partly invented to fill a need by Google for their own servers.
